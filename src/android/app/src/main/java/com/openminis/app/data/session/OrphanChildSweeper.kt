/**
 * [T-android-zombie-child-sweep] Cold-start cleanup of hidden sub agent
 * sessions whose parent no longer exists.
 *
 * A sub agent runs in a child session that is deliberately invisible: every
 * picker filters rows whose `parent_session_id` is set. That is fine while the
 * parent is around — deleting the parent cascades through SessionDeleter. It
 * is not fine when the process is killed mid-run, or when a parent disappears
 * by some path that did not cascade: the child then sits in the table forever,
 * holding its messages and its workspace, with no user-reachable way to remove
 * it. They accumulate.
 *
 * This deletes user data, so the predicate is deliberately narrow and each
 * deletion is justified in the log rather than merely counted.

     * row rather than in one transaction, so there is a window where a child is
     * present and its parent is not yet — and because the importer preserves
     * the backup's own `updatedAt`, such a child can already be older than any
     * plausible grace period. The age floor does NOT cover that case; the
     * re-check in [sweep] does. The floor's job is the ordinary one of not
     * racing live writes.
