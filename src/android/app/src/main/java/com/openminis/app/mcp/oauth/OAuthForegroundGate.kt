/**
 * [T-android-oauth-foreground-exchange] Hold a loopback-OAuth token exchange
 * until Minis is back in the foreground.
 *
 * Reported: after authorizing Anthropic in the browser — which then said the
 * tab could be closed — returning to Minis showed no sign-in at all. The
 * authorization had succeeded; the token exchange had not. Logcat on a Pixel 6
 * (Android 17 beta, WireGuard up):
 *
 *     OAuthCallbackServer: GET /callback?code=…&state=…
 *     ClaudeOAuth: Callback received — code length: 48
 *     ClaudeOAuth: Token exchange: POST https://claude.ai/v1/oauth/token
 *     OAuth sign-in failed: Unable to resolve host "claude.ai": No address associated with hostname
 *
 * 10 ms from POST to failure: not a timeout, a refusal. `dumpsys netpolicy` for
 * the app's uid shows `blocked=APP_BACKGROUND, allowed=FOREGROUND|TOP|…`.
 * While the user is in the Custom Tab, Minis is a background app and the OS
 * denies it the network — DNS answers "no address" at once — but the loopback
 * callback server still works, because localhost is never blocked. So the
 * redirect lands, the browser reports success, and the exchange fires into a
 * blocked network. The same fetch from the foreground returns 200.
 *
 * OpenAI appeared to work "after a while" only because its exchange retried
 * for ~3 s ("DNS can briefly fail after Custom Tab closes" — a guess at this
 * cause); a user who took longer to come back failed the same way. Anthropic
 * had no retry and failed every time.
 *
 * The fix is to not attempt the network while it is guaranteed to be refused:
 * after the callback, wait until the process is STARTED again (the user left
 * the browser), then exchange. The code is single-use but lives for minutes, so
 * the wait costs nothing; the managers keep a short retry behind this for the
 * brief lag between foregrounding and the policy lifting.
 *
 * Also publishes the sign-in [phase] so the provider screen can show "waiting
 * for authorization" / "completing sign-in" instead of looking signed-out.
