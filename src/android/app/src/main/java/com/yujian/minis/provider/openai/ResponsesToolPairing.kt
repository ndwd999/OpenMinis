/**
 * [T-android-responses-orphan-tool-output] Last gate before a Responses
 * request goes out: every `function_call_output` must answer a
 * `function_call` with the same `call_id` in the array, at most once, and every
 * `function_call` except the trailing run must be answered. Port of iOS
 * `sanitizeResponsesToolPairing` (bc142f750, first-output-wins from ffbed35ca).
 *
 * Why it is needed: the Responses builder emitted `function_call_output`
 * unconditionally. An upstream answers a stranded one with
 *     No tool call found for function call output with call_id call_… .
 * and, because the request is rebuilt from the same history every time, the
 * 400 repeated on every retry and every fallback model until the chat was
 * cleared (the iOS field report). ChatViewModel's history repair catches most
 * orphans one layer up, but it works on stored ids while this sees exactly the
 * ids the request carries (split on "|" and capped), and it cannot see every
 * source of a stranded or duplicated result (a retry, resume or restore that
 * left an extra result row).
 *
 * Repair, same rules as iOS:
 *  - an output whose call is not in the request is DROPPED - nothing can
 *    reconstruct the call;
 *  - a second output for the same call_id is DROPPED - the first one wins, as
 *    in the Chat Completions path;
 *  - an unanswered call gets a placeholder output instead of being deleted,
 *    which would silently discard the assistant's own turn. The TRAILING run of
 *    calls is exempt: a request ending on function_call is what the API expects
 *    mid-round, and a placeholder there would tell the model a tool it is about
 *    to run has already failed.
 *
 * Placeholders are buffered until the run of function_call items closes and
 * land before the first following item, so parallel calls stay
 * `function_call ×N, function_call_output ×N` - an output in the middle of the
 * call run, or a tool-image carrier between outputs, is itself a 400
 * ([T-android-responses-toolresult-image-split]). Order is otherwise kept as
 * built; no items are moved.
