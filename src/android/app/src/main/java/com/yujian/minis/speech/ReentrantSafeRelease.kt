/**
 * [T-android-vad-reentrant-release] Owns a native object that must never be
 * freed while a call into it is still on the stack — including a call that
 * re-enters from its own callback.
 *
 * [VoiceActivityDetector] needs both guarantees:
 *  - Cross-thread (T-android-vad, 91c7b2944): stop() on another thread must
 *    wait for an in-flight `processAudio` instead of freeing underneath it.
 *    A plain lock held across the call does that.
 *  - Same-thread re-entrancy: the library fires `onVoiceEnd` from INSIDE
 *    `RealTimeCutVAD::algorithm()`, and a listener that stops the take there
 *    (ProviderSpeechRecognitionEngine, on a silence close) reaches
 *    `release()` on the capture thread that already holds the lock. JVM
 *    monitors are re-entrant, so the lock did not stop it:
 *    `destroyVADInstance` freed the object, the callback returned into
 *    `algorithm()`, and its next read of a member through the freed `this`
 *    faulted — SIGSEGV, fault addr 0x38 at
 *    libRealtimeCutVadLibrary.so `RealTimeCutVAD::algorithm+0x2a4`.
 *
 * [tearDown] reached from inside [call] therefore only detaches the object;
 * [call] frees it after the native call has fully returned. Holding [lock]
 * while inside [call] is what makes [inCall] unambiguous: another thread in
 * [tearDown] blocks on the lock, so seeing `inCall == true` there means this
 * is the calling thread re-entering.
