 * fires `onRenderProcessGone`, and `WebView.evaluateJavascript` then never
 * calls back. Before this, nothing bounded that wait inside the pool, nothing
 * marked the tab bad, and the CLI's single-tab driver kept routing every
 * command back to the same frozen tab — each one burning 60s and returning a
 * misleading "tab busy" error, forever. iOS had the sibling bug (the CLI gave
 * up after 90s but the native side held its serial slot for 300s); on Android
 * structured concurrency already propagates the CLI's cancellation into the
 * pool and `Mutex` releases on it, so what was missing is the deadline and the
 * rebuild, not a cancel bridge.
