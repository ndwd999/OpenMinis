/**
 * [T-picker-search-relevance] [T-picker-search-debounce] [T-picker-search-cap]
 * Model-picker search: relevance scoring, a debounced query and a result cap.
 * iOS parity: ModelSearchScorer + UnifiedModelPicker (30fb01839, 0dcb55a0b;
 * GH#271, GH#272).
 *
 * Android filtered with a Bool match (`contains` / subsequence) on every
 * keystroke, kept the provider's order — so a loose subsequence hit could
 * bury an exact one — and put every match on screen. With an aggregator
 * holding 7,000+ models each keystroke re-ran the whole pass and a short query
 * mounted thousands of rows.
 *
 * Pure except [rememberDebouncedQuery], so the ranking is unit-tested
 * directly (ModelSearchTest).
