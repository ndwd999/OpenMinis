/**
 * [T-android-scheduled-triggers] Fires [ScheduledTriggerKind.ON_COMPLETION]
 * tasks. Port of iOS ScheduledJobRunner's `.onCompletion` arm, which waits for
 * `agentJobDidFinish` naming the upstream job and then fires once with
 * `{{result}}` replaced.
 *
 * Two kinds of upstream finish here:
 *  - another scheduled task's SCHEDULE ends: [ScheduledAgentRunner] calls
 *    [onScheduledRunFinished] after recording each scheduled run, and it
 *    releases the waiting tasks only after the last one;
 *  - an agent job (a background sub agent, `subagent_task` wait:false) closes
 *    in [AgentJobRegistry]: its `completions` flow, collected once per process
 *    by [ensureListening].
 *
 * Agent jobs live in memory, so a task waiting on one from a previous process
 * never fires; it stays listed as waiting until deleted. Scheduled tasks are
 * persisted, so waiting on one survives a restart.
