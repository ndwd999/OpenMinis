/**
 * Manages per-session persistent shell processes.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - PRootKernel (rootfs + proot binary): global singleton, booted once
 * - PersistentShell: one per sessionId, owns its bind mounts and /bin/sh process
 * - Per-session Mutex: different sessions can run commands concurrently
 * - ConcurrentHashMap: thread-safe shell/mutex registry
 *
 * Concurrency guarantees:
 * - Same session: commands are serialized by the per-session Mutex
 * - Different sessions: run concurrently (each has its own Mutex)
 * - Shell creation: protected by globalLock to prevent duplicate shells
 * - Shell death: detected on next command, shell is recreated with same bind mounts
