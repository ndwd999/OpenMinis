/**
 * [T-android-decorative-anim-perf] Shared machinery for decorative, always-on
 * animations: spinners, shimmers, breathing dots, pulsing glows.
 *
 * Why this file exists. Profiled on a Pixel 6 (90 Hz) with one tool running:
 * the 15 dp indeterminate spinner in the floating tool bar cost 193 `drawArc`
 * samples — and dragged 893 samples of text / image / rect re-rasterisation
 * with it, because nothing put a layer boundary between the spinner and its
 * siblings. Compose walks a draw invalidation UP to the nearest layer; with
 * no layer in between, that is the whole bar, so every frame re-recorded the
 * tile's twelve lines of monospace text to move a ring a few degrees.
 *
 * Four rules, each with a helper here so call sites cannot drift:
 *
 *  1. ISOLATE — give the animated node its own layer ([animationLayer], or a
 *     `graphicsLayer { }` lambda, which is one already) so its invalidation
 *     stops there and siblings are composited from cache.
 *  2. DEFER — read the animated value inside the `graphicsLayer { }` / draw
 *     lambda, never in composition. A composition-phase read recomposes the
 *     node every frame; a layer-phase read touches nothing but the layer.
 *  3. NO PER-FRAME ALLOCATION — brushes, colours and strokes are hoisted or
 *     cached; the frame path only writes a float.
 *  4. ONE THROTTLED CLOCK — every decorative animation derives its phase from
 *     [DecorativeClock], a single ~30 fps tick shared by all readers. A 2.8 s
 *     shimmer or a 1 s spin does not earn the panel's full refresh rate, and
 *     N independent `rememberInfiniteTransition`s meant N invalidation
 *     sources per frame. The clock runs only while something is reading it.
 *
 * Content the user tracks (scroll, drag, transitions) is NOT decorative and
 * must not be routed through this clock.
 */

/**

 * invalidations inside do not re-record anything outside. Use it around

 * animation you do not control; use the `graphicsLayer { }` lambda form
 * directly when you are also animating a layer property.

/**
 * [T-android-decorative-anim-perf] A drop-in replacement for Material's
 * indeterminate [androidx.compose.material3.CircularProgressIndicator] that
 * costs a layer property per tick instead of a frame-rate animation.
 *
 * Material's spinner owns a private `InfiniteTransition` running at the
 * panel's refresh rate, and nothing outside it can throttle that — measured
 * on a 90 Hz Pixel 6, wrapping it in a layer cut the *collateral* re-recording
 * of sibling text but the screen still produced 87 fps because the spinner
 * kept asking for every frame. It also drags a Material semantics node
 * (ProgressBarRangeInfo) along, and the semantics tree walk was itself
 * hundreds of samples per capture.
 *
 * This draws the same visual — a rotating arc — from the shared ~30 fps
 * [DecorativeClock], records the arc exactly once, and animates only
 * `rotationZ` on its own layer. No semantics, no per-frame recomposition, no
 * allocation on the frame path.
 *
 * Use it for decorative "работа идёт" spinners. Anything conveying real
 * determinate progress should stay a Material indicator so it keeps its
 * accessibility semantics.
