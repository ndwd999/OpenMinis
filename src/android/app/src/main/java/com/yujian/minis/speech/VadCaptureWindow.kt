/**
 * [T-android-vad-manual-stop] How much audio around the VAD's own segment a
 * flushed take should carry.
 *
 * Silero reports speech only once it is CONFIRMED and ends a segment as soon
 * as its silence window is satisfied, so the audio it hands over is trimmed at
 * both ends: the onset spoken while it was still deciding, and the decay of
 * the final syllable. Feeding that to a recogniser drops leading and trailing
 * words — reported as "识别到的内容一直没有前面两个字".
 *
 * Both ends are therefore padded from the raw capture: a pre-roll ring held
 * before confirmation, and a tail hold kept after the endpoint. This object
 * exists so the frame arithmetic is checkable without a microphone.
