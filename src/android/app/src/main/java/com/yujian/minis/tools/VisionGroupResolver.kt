/**
 * [T-android-vision-group / GH#182] Image understanding for main models that
 * can't see. Android port of iOS `VisionGroupResolver`.
 *
 * A "Vision Group" is an ordinary [com.yujian.minis.data.model.ModelGroup] that
 * `ProviderConfig.visionGroupId` points at — deliberately NOT a new group kind.
 * That reuses the existing member ordering / availability filtering for free and
 * leaves ModelGroup (and its iCloud CRDT member maps) untouched; the pointer is
 * per-device local state, exactly like voiceInputGroupId / voiceOutputGroupId.
 *
 * Flow: when the session's model has no image-input modality but a Vision Group
 * is configured, `read_image` is still exposed. The tool then sends the image to
 * a vision-capable member of that group and returns its DESCRIPTION as tool TEXT,
 * so the main model learns the image's content without ever receiving pixels it
 * can't decode.
