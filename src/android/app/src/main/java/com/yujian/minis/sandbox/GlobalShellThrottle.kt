/**
 * [T-android-global-shell-throttle] Admits agent shell commands against a
 * budget of Minis child processes, across ALL sessions. A command that does
 * not fit waits in a FIFO queue; it is never refused.
 *
 * Why: every running command is a PRoot process tree (libproot + /bin/sh +
 * the command's children), and Android 12+ kills phantom processes beyond
 * `max_phantom_processes` (32 by default). Main chat, helper agents,
 * sub-agents and scheduled tasks can each fan out several shell calls at
 * once; nothing bounded the total, so a burst could cross that budget and
 * have processes SIGKILLed mid-command.
 *
 * [T-android-shell-process-budget] Why a process budget and not a command
 * count: a fixed "3 commands" was never measured and was both too strict (a
 * `sleep` is 4 processes, so three of them use 12 of 32) and blind to what
 * actually costs - a 4-stage pipeline is 7 processes, a leftover daemon
 * holds processes after its command returned. The app cannot read the
 * system limit or other apps' processes (no DUMP permission, /proc of other
 * uids is denied), but it can count its own descendants in /proc, so the
 * gate admits a command while that live count stays within [PROCESS_BUDGET],
 * half the default 32, leaving the rest for other apps (IMEs and chat apps
 * keep a few children of their own).
 *
 * Scope and limits, deliberately:
 *  - Only command execution is gated. The interactive terminal (a
 *    user-owned PTY) is not; queueing a person's keystrokes behind agent
 *    work would be the wrong trade. Its processes still count toward the
 *    live total, so agent commands give way to it.
 *  - A command is always admitted when no other gated command is running,
 *    so processes nobody is waiting on (a leaked daemon) can slow commands
 *    to one at a time but never stall them.
 *  - Queue time does not come out of the command's own timeout: a queued
 *    command runs with its full budget. The queue has its own safety cap,
 *    [MAX_QUEUE_WAIT_MS], so an unforeseen wait-cycle cannot hang forever.
 *  - A command whose process could not even be started (the caller's
 *    [run] `isStartFailure`) ran nothing, so it goes back into the queue and
 *    is retried after a backoff. A command that started and then failed or
 *    was killed is never retried: it may have had side effects.
 *  - Waiting is cancellable (Stop, turn cancel) and holds no reservation.
