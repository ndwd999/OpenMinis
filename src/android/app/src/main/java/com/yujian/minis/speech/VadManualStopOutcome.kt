 * [T-android-vad-manual-stop] What a manually-stopped VAD take should do with

 * without an AudioRecord: the engine itself binds the mic and a Context and
 * cannot be constructed in a JVM test, and this decision is the whole of the
 * bug that was fixed — a manual stop used to fall off the end of the VAD path
 * producing NO terminal callback at all, leaving SpeechRecognitionManager in
 * FINISHING and the panel spinning on "Recognizing…" forever.
