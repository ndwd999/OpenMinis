/**
 * [T-android-voice-asr-stall-skip] Runs ASR attempts so a stalled one can be
 * skipped. Port of iOS `SkippableASRAttempts` (9f6207b05 / 4a1f44220).
 *
 * The fail-over chain only advanced when an attempt THREW. An attempt that
 * simply never returned — a half-dead connection, or an inference server that
 * accepted the upload and went quiet — held the take for up to OkHttp's
 * 120 s read timeout per candidate, and the user's only way out was to cancel
 * and lose the audio.
 *
 * Each attempt that has somewhere to go next is marked stalled after
 * [stallThresholdMs] without a result, which raises [stalled]; [skipStalled]
 * then releases every stalled caller at once with [Skipped] and cancels the
 * provider's work as a courtesy. It does not rely on the provider honouring
 * cancellation (a blocking OkHttp call may not): the attempt's late result is
 * simply discarded.
