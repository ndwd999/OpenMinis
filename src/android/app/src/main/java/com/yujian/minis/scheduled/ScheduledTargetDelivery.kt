/**
 * [T-android-scheduled-default-follow-up] Where a scheduled task's fires land,
 * decided and announced in one place. Port of iOS `ScheduledTargetDelivery`
 * (c32dda5a7), without its child-of-current case (Android's CLI has no such
 * target).
 *
 * 1. Default target. `minis-scheduled create` without `--target` used to mean
 *    `new`, so a model that asked for "remind me in this chat" and simply left
 *    the flag out got every fire in a separate chat: the result never came
 *    back to the conversation that asked for it. Run from inside a chat, the
 *    default is now `follow-up` (this chat). With no chat behind the command
 *    (a script, an external automation) it stays `new`.
 * 2. Delivery sentence. `create` answers with one plain sentence saying where
 *    the fires will land, and whether the target was defaulted, so a wrong
 *    target is visible at once and can be corrected with delete + create
 *    instead of being discovered when the first fire goes missing.
 *
 * Pure (no Android types) so `ScheduledTargetDeliveryTest` runs on the JVM.
