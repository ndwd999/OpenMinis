/**
 * [T-voice-mic-preempted] Tells "another app holds the microphone" apart from
 * a genuine capture failure. Port of iOS 3a2e3e305 (issue #283).
 *
 * On iOS a mic taken by FaceTime / a call surfaced as "Parse failed:
 * Microphone input unavailable". Android had two versions of the same fault:
 *  - the recorder could not be created or started, and the panel showed the
 *    engine's raw English ("AudioRecord not initialized.", "Microphone
 *    unavailable: <exception>");
 *  - more often, since Android 10's concurrent-capture rules, the recording
 *    STARTS but the system feeds it silence while a call or another recorder
 *    owns the input. Nothing noticed, so the mic appeared to listen until the
 *    silence timeout and the take ended as "nothing recognized".
 *
 * Both now end as [RecognitionError.MIC_IN_USE] with a translated message
 * naming the cause and the fix. The engine detail goes to the log only.
