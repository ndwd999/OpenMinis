/**
 * [T-android-scheduled-task-card] The envelope a scheduled task's prompt is
 * wrapped in so the transcript can tell it apart from something the user typed.
 *
 * A fired task sends its prompt through the ordinary prompt path, so without a
 * marker the resulting message is indistinguishable from a user message — the
 * user sees text they never wrote and has no way to learn which task produced
 * it, or that a task produced it at all.
 *
 * Modelled on `AgentCallback`: a leading tag the flattener recognises, parses,
 * and lifts into a card instead of a bubble. Kept deliberately small — it
 * carries only what the card must show and what the cancel action needs, and
 * the prompt itself follows verbatim so a build that does not know the tag
 * still shows something sensible rather than an empty bubble.
 *
 * Wire shape (attributes are single-line, the body is the untouched prompt):
 *
 *     <scheduled_task id="…" label="…" next="…">
 *     the prompt text
 *     </scheduled_task>
 *
 * [T-scheduled-tool-prefill] A task with a prefilled tool call adds
 * `prefilled="<tool>"` and opens the body with [prefillNote]. The model reads
 * the raw envelope, and the attribute alone did not say what to DO: the note
 * (verbatim the iOS wording, ScheduledPresetToolCall.envelopeNote) tells it
 * the tool call that follows was already made for it and that it should work
 * from that output, re-running only on failure — without it the model sees a
 * call it has no memory of deciding on, and may run it again. [parse] strips
 * the note back off, so the card shows the prompt alone. Readers that predate
 * the attribute ignore it.
 *
 * [T-scheduled-preemptive-insert] A fire delivered into a session whose agent
 * loop is still running is slipped in between two tool calls rather than held
 * until the whole run ends. Its envelope adds `inserted="1"` and opens with
 * [insertionReminder] instead of the prefill note: the model must learn that
 * this turn was dropped into the middle of its own work (not produced by its
 * last tool call, not started by it), what to do with a prefilled result, and
 * that it should go back to the interrupted task afterwards. [parse] strips it
 * like the note.
