/**
 * [T-android-browser-global-tab-cap] Process-wide cap on live WebView tabs
 * across every [BrowserTabPool].
 *
 * Why this exists: [T-android-browser-tab-ownership] raised a pool's ceiling
 * from 3 to [BrowserTabPool.MAX_TABS_WITH_AGENTS] = 6 so concurrent sub agents
 * would stop closing each other's tabs. But an Android pool is NOT a singleton
 * the way iOS's effectively is — one is built per chat ViewModel
 * (`ChatViewModel.kt`), one is resident for `minis-browser-use`
 * (`MinisApp.kt`), and the session list builds one of its own
 * (`SessionListScreen.kt`). So the raised ceiling multiplies by the number of
 * live pools: two chats each running two sub agents is a theoretical peak of
 * 2 x 6 = 12 WebViews. Each Android WebView carries its own out-of-process
 * renderer (tens of MB resident, plus a process record the LMK counts), which
 * is heavier than iOS's WKWebView — that peak is a reclaim storm, not a
 * capacity plan.
 *
 * The fix is a cross-pool gate rather than lowering the per-pool ceiling,
 * because the per-pool number is doing a different and still-correct job:
 * bounding how many tabs ONE conversation's agents may fan out to. Lowering it
 * would re-break the incident that raised it (agents closing each other's
 * tabs) on a single-chat device, where nothing is actually over budget. What
 * is over budget is the process total, and only something above the pools can
 * see that.
 *
 * Arbitration is ported verbatim from iOS `BrowserTabPoolRegistry.requestSlot`
 * (`src/ios/Agent/BrowserUse/BrowserTabPool.swift`) — the semantics are
 * already settled there and are deliberately not re-litigated:
 *
 *  1. under [GLOBAL_TAB_CAP] -> admit
 *  2. otherwise evict the least-recently-active IDLE tab in a SIBLING pool
 *  3. otherwise preempt the least-recently-active BUSY tab in a sibling pool
 *  4. no sibling tabs at all -> deny
 *
 * The requester's own pool is excluded from every pass: a pool must never
 * solve its own admission by cannibalising itself, or an agent's two tabs
 * would take turns destroying each other.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * **The registry is main-thread-confined and takes no locks of its own.**
 *
 * That is the whole concurrency strategy, and it is what makes the documented
 * hazard — "never hold pool A's lock while reaching for pool B's" —
 * structurally impossible rather than merely avoided by care:
 *
 *  - Every tab-mutating path in [BrowserTabPool] already runs inside
 *    `withContext(Dispatchers.Main)` (`acquireTab`, `newTab`, `closeTab`,
 *    `createTab`'s callers, `evictIdleTabs`). The registry is only ever
 *    entered from those paths, so [pools] and every victim pool's tab list are
 *    touched on one thread. No mutex is needed to protect them, so there is no
 *    registry lock that could participate in a cycle.
 *  - `BrowserTabPool.executeSerialized` DOES hold a per-tab [kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex]
 *    while the call stack below it reaches `createTab` and therefore this
 *    registry. That is the inversion risk, and it is defused by the registry
 *    never acquiring a `tabLocks` mutex — not the requester's and not the
 *    victim's. Eviction reaches the victim pool through
 *    [RegistryPool.evictTabForRegistry] / [RegistryPool.preemptTabForRegistry],
 *    which mutate `_tabs` and tear the WebView down directly. A victim tab
 *    whose serial mutex is held by some other coroutine is preempted anyway;
 *    that coroutine discovers it on its next call and gets a retry hint (see
 *    [RegistryPool.preemptTabForRegistry]). Waiting for that mutex is exactly
 *    the deadlock we are refusing to build.
 *  - Consequently the registry's methods must stay synchronous and non-
 *    suspending. A `suspend` here would invite someone to `withLock` inside it
 *    later, which is the failure this note exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Single-pool devices see nothing
 *
 * With one chat open and no agents running, `totalLiveTabs()` sits at 1-3
 * against a cap of [GLOBAL_TAB_CAP], so [requestSlot] returns true on its
 * first line without scanning anything. Step 4 also means a lone pool at cap
 * is DENIED rather than made to eat its own tabs — but a lone pool can never
 * reach the global cap in the first place, since its own ceiling (6) is below
 * it. Covered by `BrowserTabPoolRegistryTest`.

     * iOS uses 8. Android keeps 8 as well, deliberately, even though an
     * Android WebView is the heavier of the two: the number has to sit ABOVE a
     * single pool's own ceiling ([BrowserTabPool.MAX_TABS_WITH_AGENTS] = 6) or
     * the registry would start arbitrating the ordinary single-chat case that
     * per-pool ownership already handles correctly — a user with one chat and
     * two sub agents would suddenly see tabs evicted for no reason visible to
     * them. That leaves 7 or 8 as the only real candidates, and 8 gives one
     * fully-loaded agent chat (6) room to coexist with the resident
     * `minis-browser-use` pool (1-2) without either preempting the other,
     * which is the exact pair that is always live. The peak this replaces is
     * 12+, so the reduction is already the bulk of the win; shaving to 7 would
     * buy one WebView at the cost of making that common pair contend.
