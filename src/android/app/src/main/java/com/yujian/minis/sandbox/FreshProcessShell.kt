/**
 * [T-android-shell-fresh-process] Runs one command in its own PRoot process
 * and reads the exit code from the process itself.
 *
 * Step 2 of the migration away from in-band completion markers. See
 * [ShellExecutionStrategy] for the measurements and the two rejected
 * alternatives (FD 3, FIFO).
 *
 * What disappears here, compared with [PersistentShell]:
 *
 *  - **No `__MINIS_DONE__` marker.** Nothing is appended to the command's
 *    output and nothing is scanned for in it, so no command can forge
 *    completion by echoing a string. Completion is the command's own exit,
 *    reported out of band by the runner's status file (see
 *    [ForegroundCommandGroup.wrapForFreshProcess]) — proot's exit alone is
 *    not enough, because proot outlives any command that leaves a detached
 *    daemon behind.
 *  - **No carry-over buffer.** The marker was the only reason to hold bytes
 *    back between reads, and holding bytes back is what swallowed every short
 *    output in the regression this replaces.
 *  - **No cross-command contamination.** Each command owns its pipes. A
 *    runaway cannot write into the stream a later command reads, because that
 *    stream dies with it.
 *  - **No shell recycling after a timeout.** `destroyForcibly()` takes the
 *    process and its pipes together.
 *
 * Environment handling mirrors [PersistentShell.startProcess] exactly — the
 * same PROOT_* variables, TZ refresh, session id for native_offload, and the
 * seccomp fallback — so a command sees the identical environment either way.
 * That is what makes the two paths comparable in step 3.
