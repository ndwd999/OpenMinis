/**
 * [T-android-selection-offscreen-order] (GH#296) Where a text shard sits in the
 * document, independent of whether it is composed right now.
 *
 * A selection that grows past one screen scrolls its start out of the
 * LazyColumn (the handle drag auto-scrolls at the edge). The start shard then
 * unregisters, and everything that ordered shards by their on-screen y — which
 * endpoint comes first, which shards lie between them, which text to copy —
 * lost its footing: the highlight vanished from every paragraph between the
 * endpoints, and a copy returned only the tail of the last shard.
 *
 * The chat already had a document-order key (`shardOrderKey`, 0224dacb1), but
 * it parsed the number after the last ':' of the shard id, and 958ff9290 then
 * suffixed every MdText id with `#<subIndex>` — "3#0" is not an int, so the key
 * was null for every shard in the chat and ordering silently fell back to y.
 * It was also only an index within one parent block, so it could not order
 * blocks of different parents, nor different messages.
 *
 * [DocOrder] is (row in the flattened chat list, sub-index within that row),
 * which orders any two shards of the chat, across blocks and messages.

 *
 * Kept separate from [TextShard] so the logic can be exercised without a
