/**
 * Shared state between the inline voice panel and the chat composer's send
 * paths. Process-scoped like [VoiceModePrefs]: only one voice panel is ever on
 * screen, and the composer (which owns Send) and the panel (which owns the
 * recognizer callbacks) are separate composables.
 *
 * Two jobs, mirroring iOS VoiceInputViewModel:
 *
 *  - [T-voice-send-waits-for-asr] "Does voice mode still owe text?" and the
 *    wait-then-send that Send performs when it does ([finishCaptureForSend]).
 *    Before this, Send while recording cleared the composer, which made the
 *    panel CANCEL the capture — the last sentence spoken before the tap never
 *    reached the message.
 *  - [T-voice-asr-failure-retry-prompt] The queue of failed utterances whose
 *    audio is kept until the user picks Retry or Discard.
