/**
 * [T-android-hwkeyboard-virtual-false-positive] "Is a real, external
 * hardware keyboard attached?" — the question the composer and the terminal
 * both ask before deciding whether to keep focus / skip dismissing the IME.
 *
 * The previous answer was `Configuration.keyboard == KEYBOARD_QWERTY &&
 * hardKeyboardHidden == HARDKEYBOARDHIDDEN_NO`. That is what Android
 * computes from the set of attached input devices, and it counts ANY device
 * that presents an alphabetic key layout — including virtual ones. Measured
 * on a Pixel 4a with no keyboard in sight: a `scrcpy --keyboard=uhid`
 * session registers a uinput device (`bus=0x0006`, `Classes: KEYBOARD |
 * ALPHAKEY`, `Generic.kcm`), the Configuration flips to `qwerty/v/v`, and
 * from then on sending a message no longer dismissed the on-screen keyboard.
 * The hardware-keyboard commit (cdf61e8ff) had verified `nokeys` on a Pixel
 * 6 — one that happened not to be mirrored at the time.
 *
 * The user-visible contract of that feature is "your hands are on physical
 * keys, so keep the caret in the box". A virtual HID device from a screen
 * mirror, a game controller's alpha map, or a TV remote satisfies the
 * Configuration check without satisfying the contract. So the decision is
 * made from the devices themselves:
 *
 *   - [InputDevice.isVirtual] excludes the framework's own virtual keyboard
 *     (`uinput-fpc … built-in keyboard`, `-1: Virtual`).
 *   - [InputDevice.isExternal] (API 29) excludes built-in button devices
 *     (`gpio-keys`, `qpnp_pon`, headset jacks) that also carry KEYBOARD
 *     class bits.
 *   - KEYBOARD_TYPE_ALPHABETIC excludes DPAD-only remotes.
 *
 * A scrcpy UHID keyboard is `bus=0x0006` (virtual bus) and, being created by
 * the UHID driver rather than a physical transport, is NOT reported as
 * external — so it drops out here while a real Bluetooth / USB keyboard,
 * which IS external, still qualifies.
 *
 * Below API 29 `isExternal` does not exist, so the Configuration check is
 * kept as the fallback: it is the old behaviour, not a regression, on the
 * handful of API 26–28 devices.
 *
 * [rememberHasHardwareKeyboard] re-evaluates on device add/remove (so a
 * Bluetooth keyboard connecting mid-session is picked up, like the
 * Configuration approach was) and also when Configuration changes, which
 * covers a folding cover flipping `hardKeyboardHidden`.
