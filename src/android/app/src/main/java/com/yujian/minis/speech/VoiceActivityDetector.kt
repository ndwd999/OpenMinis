/**
 * [T-android-vad] Silero-VAD speech segmentation for Android.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Android previously had no VAD at all. The System engine relied on the
 * platform recognizer's own endpointing — which is OEM-specific, so the same
 * app segmented differently on Pixel vs vivo vs Xiaomi — and the Provider
 * (custom-model) engine had *no* endpointing whatsoever: it recorded until the
 * user tapped stop or hit a 60 s cap. This class gives both engines one
 * deterministic, device-independent notion of "the user stopped talking".
 *
 * ## Same model as iOS, on purpose
 *
 * `RealTimeCutVADLibraryForAndroid` is the Android build of the very library
 * iOS uses through SPM (`RealTimeCutVADLibrary`) — same author, same Silero v5
 * + ONNX Runtime + WebRTC APM stack, same six-parameter threshold call. So the
 * tunables below are copied verbatim from
 * `src/ios/Providers/Voice/VoiceActivityDetector.swift` and the two platforms
 * segment identically.
 *
 * ## Do not use the library's default thresholds
 *
 * The library's README suggests `(0.7, 0.7, 0.5, 0.95, 10, 57)`. Two of those
 * are wrong for us:
 *  - end frames `57` ≈ 1.8 s, where iOS waits ~5 s ([END_FRAMES]); and
 *  - start/end probability `0.7`, which iOS tried and reverted — its comment
 *    records that at 0.7 the VAD "logged speechDetected=false across hundreds
 *    of frames while the user was actually speaking, so no segment was ever
 *    emitted."
 * [applyThresholds] therefore always calls `setVADThreshold` explicitly.
