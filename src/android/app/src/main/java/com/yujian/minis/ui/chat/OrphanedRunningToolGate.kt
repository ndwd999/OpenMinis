/**
 * [T-android-orphaned-running-tool-spin] Decides whether a tool block may keep
 * rendering as RUNNING.
 *
 * Measured on a Pixel 6: opening a 144-message session took the app from 0% to
 * a sustained 85-130% of a CPU core while completely idle, producing 730 frames
 * in 8 seconds (91 fps) with no stream, no task and nothing on screen changing.
 * Backgrounding the app dropped it to 0%; reopening that one session brought it
 * straight back. Smaller sessions never did it.
 *
 * The session contained exactly one tool block still marked RUNNING, left over
 * from a sub-agent delegation whose completion never landed. A RUNNING block
 * draws a `rememberInfiniteTransition` shimmer (ChatAssistantMessageUI
 * `toolPillShimmer`), and an infinite transition invalidates every frame for as
 * long as it is composed — so one orphaned block pins the whole UI at display
 * refresh rate forever, heating the device and draining battery with no work
 * being done.
 *
 * Two things conspired to make the state permanent:
 *
 *  - `delegateBlockOverrides` (ChatViewModel) is a process-lifetime map keyed
 *    by tool id. It is cleared per-tool on completion but never on session
 *    load, so a delegate that never completed keeps re-applying RUNNING over
 *    the freshly rebuilt blocks on every single reload.
 *  - The DB rebuild path itself can never produce RUNNING (it derives
 *    SUCCESS / FAILED / CANCELLED from the persisted tool_result), so the
 *    stale override is the only source of truth that says "still running" —
 *    and nothing ever contradicts it.
 *
 * The rule below closes that: RUNNING is a claim about *right now*, so it must
 * be backed by a live job. A block whose job is gone is not running, whatever
 * the persisted or overridden status says.
