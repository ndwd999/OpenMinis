/**
 * T-bg-overlay phase 2: floating tool-status overlay.
 *
 * Adds a small draggable capsule via [WindowManager] using
 * TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY (requires SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW). The capsule
 * shows the Minis launcher logo, the running tool's label, and a short
 * status — same data the FGS notification reads
 * (`SessionActivityTracker.currentToolName` / `currentToolStatus`).
 *
 * T-bg-overlay-polish: the per-tool icon was replaced with the Minis
 * launcher icon clipped to a circle, a thin stroke ring rotates around
 * the logo while a tool is running, and a small success/error glyph
 * leads the second row once a tool finishes.
 *
 * Owned by [AgentForegroundService]; created on service start, destroyed
 * on service stop. Visibility is driven by the service's collector:
 *
 *   - Minis foreground OR no tool running OR user toggle OFF OR no perm → hidden
 *   - otherwise → shown, content updated on each tool-status change
 *
 * Position persists in [com.yujian.minis.data.repository.BackgroundSettingsRepository]
 * across process restarts; first run defaults to the bottom-left corner
 * (10 dp from each edge). Tap dismisses to bring Minis back to the
 * foreground; drag moves the capsule.
