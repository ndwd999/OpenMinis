/**
 * [T-android-opencode-session-header] Attach `x-opencode-session` to requests
 * bound for OpenCode Go.
 *
 * OpenCode Go (`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`, OpenAI-compatible) began
 * enforcing this header on 2026-09-06; without it the endpoint answers
 * `400 "Request is missing x-opencode-session and cannot be routed
 * efficiently"` (GH #327), which left Minis unusable against the service
 * (GH #304). The value is what the operator calls "one stable ID per
 * conversation" and is used to key their prompt cache.
 *
 * The operator's stated requirements, and how each is met:
 *
 *  1. *A non-sensitive, unique session ID (a random UUID is fine).* Chat
 *     session ids are `UUID.randomUUID()` (ChatRepository.createSession), so
 *     they carry no account, key or device identity.
 *  2. *Stable across every request, retry and resumption of one conversation;
 *     a new conversation gets a new one.* The id is the session's DB primary
 *     key, so it survives restarts and provider re-creation (model switch,
 *     fallback, OAuth refresh) — see [headersFor]'s contract about
 *     WHICH id callers must pass.
 *  3. *Keep identifying the client honestly in the User-Agent.* Untouched —
 *     this adds a header and never edits the UA, which still reports Minis
 *     via [MinisUserAgent].
 *  4. *No API key or personal information in the id.* Guaranteed by (1).
 *
 * ## Why the header is gated on the host rather than sent everywhere
 *
 * Sending it unconditionally would hand a stable per-conversation identifier
 * to every third-party endpoint a user configures, which is a tracking vector
 * we would be introducing on their behalf. The gate is a privacy control, not
 * a feature switch.
 *
 * ## Why host equality/suffix rather than `contains("opencode.ai")`
 *
 * A substring test also matches `https://opencode.ai.example.com/v1` and
 * `https://not-opencode.ai/v1` — hosts controlled by someone else entirely —
 * so the cheap check leaks the very identifier it exists to protect. Parsing
 * the URL and comparing the host (exactly, or as a dot-anchored subdomain)
 * costs one call and cannot be spoofed by a crafted prefix or suffix.
