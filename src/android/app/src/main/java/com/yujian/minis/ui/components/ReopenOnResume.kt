/**
 * [T-android-picker-provider-edit] Reopen a sheet after the screen it handed
 * off to is popped.
 *
 * iOS opens a provider's settings (or Model Groups) as a sheet over the model
 * picker, so closing them lands back in the picker. Android pushes a route
 * instead, and the picker must close first (a bottom sheet left open lingers
 * behind the pushed screen). Call the returned function right before
 * navigating; [onReopen] then runs on the first ON_RESUME after it. The flag is
 * saveable because the host screen leaves composition while the pushed route
 * is on top.
