/**
 * [T-android-settle-programmatic-scroll] Decides whether the post-drag
 * "settle" re-pin (T170, mirrors iOS settleAfterInteraction) may fire.
 *
 * The settle exists for one situation: the user's finger was on the list, the
 * streaming auto-follow was suppressed while they dragged, content grew in the
 * meantime, and the finger lifted near the bottom — so one extra pin catches
 * the growth that was missed. It was driven from the
 * `isScrollInProgress -> false` edge, which is wrong: the auto-follow glide is
 * itself a `listState.scroll { }` block, so every glide that finished also
 * flipped that edge and the settle snapped `scrollToItem(0, 0)` on top of it.
 * Measured on a Pixel 4a during a 300-paragraph stream: 103 settle fires in
 * one turn, and on screen a repeating pattern of an eased glide followed by an
 * instant jump — the "来回抖" the user reported. Programmatic scrolls emit no
 * DragInteraction; only a real finger lift records [msSinceDrag]'s timestamp.
 *
 * Pure so it can be unit-tested; the composable passes its own state in.
