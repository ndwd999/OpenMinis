/**
 * [T-android-empty-turn-reminder-any-tail] Decides how the agent loop recovers
 * from an EMPTY model turn — one where the model produced no text and no tool
 * call and simply stopped.
 *
 * Background: `runAgentLoop` classifies a turn as empty via
 * `turnText.isEmpty() && toolCalls.isEmpty()`. An empty turn is high-
 * probability whenever the conversation ends on a STATEMENT the model owes no
 * reply to. The one that triggered this work is a finished sub-agent callback
 * (`<agent_callback kind="finished">…</agent_callback>`): a "here is a completed
 * result" notice with no instruction. Measured against the live Codex endpoint
 * on GPT-5.6 Terra, a request ending on such a callback returned an empty turn
 * 7/10 times, so a user tapping Retry saw "Model returned an empty response"
 * over and over. A tool_result tail (the case the loop already handled) is just
 * one shape of the same problem.
 *
 * The recovery is: remove the empty assistant turn, append a one-shot
 * `<system-reminder>` nudging the model to continue, and retry ONE round. This
 * object decides WHERE the reminder goes; the loop performs the mutation and
 * owns the once-per-run guard. Keeping the decision pure lets it be tested
 * without a live ViewModel (mirrors ImageInputPreflight / FallbackPulseGate).

     *
     * This encodes the loop's gate `!hasVisibleContent && finishedCleanly` in
     * one testable place, and — following the iOS reasoning-only guidance
     * (AIChatViewModel.swift isEmptyResponse) — makes the stop-reason
     * NARROWING explicit rather than implicit:
     *
     *  - A turn that produced text or a tool call is never empty.
     *  - Only a terminal "done" stop (`stop` / `end_turn`, or a null stop from
     *    a dropped stream that the caller has already decided to treat as
     *    empty) qualifies. `length` (truncated / max_output_tokens — often the
     *    reasoning phase) does NOT: it kept partial output.
     *  - `tool_calls` / `tool_use` with no tool call and no text IS empty
     *    ([T-android-tooluse-stop-no-calls]): there is nothing to continue the
     *    loop with, so without this the run just stopped silently.
     *  - REASONING-ONLY is the subtle case. Interleaved thinking emits a
     *    reasoning block and then CALLS A TOOL — that turn ends on `tool_use`
     *    and has [hasToolCall] = true, so it is excluded here (and in the loop
     *    it never even reaches this gate: the block is inside
     *    `if (toolCalls.isEmpty())`). A reasoning-only turn that ends on
     *    `stop` / `end_turn` with no text and no tool is the stall the user
     *    sees as "the run just ended" — it IS empty and must be recovered.
     *    So `hasReasoning` is deliberately NOT an exemption on this API:
     *    reasoning that "led somewhere" already shows up as a tool call.
     *
     * @param hasText the turn produced non-blank assistant text.
     * @param hasToolCall the turn produced at least one tool call.
     * @param stopReason the turn's finish reason (provider string, or null).
