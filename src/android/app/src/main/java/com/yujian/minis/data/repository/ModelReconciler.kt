/**
 * [T-provider-refresh-outlives-screen] (GH#265) Runs a provider's model-list
 * refresh in a scope that belongs to the repository, not to the screen that
 * asked for it.
 *
 * The bug: Add Provider saved the instance, launched
 * `refreshModels(instance)` on the screen's `rememberCoroutineScope()`, and
 * called `onSaved()` on the very next line, which pops the screen. Popping
 * disposes the composition and cancels that scope, so the fetch died before
 * it reached the network and the new provider kept the built-in placeholder
 * catalog — for xAI, a list without `grok-4.6` — until the user found
 * Models ▸ Refresh by hand. A model refresh is background data sync; it must
 * not share the lifetime of a screen that is about to go away.
 *
 * The instance is looked up by id when the job RUNS, so it refreshes what is
 * saved at that moment (a deleted instance is skipped), and a failure is
 * logged rather than thrown into a scope with no one listening.
