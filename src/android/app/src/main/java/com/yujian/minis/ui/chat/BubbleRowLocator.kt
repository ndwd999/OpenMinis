/**
 * [T-android-bubble-anchor] Maps a user bubble to the persisted row it came
 * from, for retry, delete-from-here and edit. Port of iOS `locateUserBubble`
 * (6c0de68f5, which replaced 8a1bf2e8b): link, don't count.
 *
 * All three operations cut the DB at a row and rebuild the model-facing
 * history from what survives, so the row they pick is exactly what the model
 * keeps. They used to pick it with three private copies of an ordinal match
 * ("the n-th user bubble is the n-th visible user row"), each with its own
 * idea of "visible":
 *  - retry and delete skipped rows with no text part and `<system-reminder>`
 *    rows;
 *  - edit additionally stripped the `<user-attached-files>` XML first;
 *  - the UI side counted every user bubble.
 * An image-only message renders a bubble but has no text part, so it was
 * counted on screen and skipped in the DB: every later retry/delete/edit
 * anchored one turn too late. When the target was the last user turn the
 * match ran off the end, nothing was cut, and an edit then appended the new
 * text after the old one - the model still read the pre-edit message (the
 * iOS field report, reproduced here through a different skew).
 *
 * Every user bubble already carries its row: a live send, a mid-loop queue
 * injection and a steer take the persisted row's id as the bubble id, a loaded
 * bubble has `id == row id` plus [ChatMessage.sourceDbIds], and the bubbles of
 * an end-of-run queue drain are linked through [ChatMessage.sourceDbIds]
 * ([T-android-bubble-anchor-drain]). So the row is found by id, with no
 * counting. Only a bubble with no row - a queued placeholder that was
 * never persisted - falls back to the ordinal rule, with one shared
 * definition of a visible row and a warning in the log.
 *
 * iOS also needs a "pending" state for a bubble whose history entry is not
 * appended yet. Android creates the bubble only after its row is persisted,
 * and all three operations are refused while a turn is running, so that
 * window does not exist here.
