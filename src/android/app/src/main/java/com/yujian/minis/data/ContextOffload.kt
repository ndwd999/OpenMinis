/**
 * Per-session offload storage helpers — write large tool outputs to disk so
 * the model can `file_read` them later while we replace the in-history copy
 * with a tiny `[CONTEXT OFFLOADED] ... <linux-path>` stub.
 *
 * Mirrors iOS `AIChatViewModel.minisOffloadsPersistentDir(for:)`,
 * `offloadContextContent(_:toolId:toolName:ext:)`, and
 * `offloadContextImage(_:toolId:mimeType:)` (AIChatViewModel.swift:6964 +
 * 7170 + 7188). Same path layout — `.../offloads/tools/<name>_<id>.<ext>` —
 * so file_read paths round-trip across platforms when an Android-offloaded
 * session is opened on iOS (or vice versa) via cloud sync.
 *
 * Linux-visible mount: `/var/minis/offloads/tools/<file>`. The host base
 * `filesDir/minis-sessions/<sid>/offloads` is bind-mounted into the
 * sandbox by [com.yujian.minis.sandbox.PRootKernel.perSessionSubdirs]
 * (which already includes the "offloads" subdir — no kernel changes
 * required for this feature).
