/**
 * [T-android-voice-pipeline-trace] One tagged event per stage of a voice-input
 * take, so a "recording finished but no text appeared" report can be pinned to
 * a specific seam instead of guessed at.
 *
 * The chain a take passes through:
 *
 *   panel.start → manager.start → engine.start → capture.begin →
 *   capture.end → transcribe.begin → (transcribe.try …) →
 *   engine.final | engine.error → manager.final | manager.error →
 *   panel.commit
 *
 * A missing event names the broken link: capture.end with no transcribe.begin
 * is a capture-side stall, transcribe.begin with no engine.final is the
 * network round-trip, engine.final with no panel.commit is the UI hand-off
 * (the panel drops a result while editing, and dropping it silently is
 * exactly the reported symptom).
 *
 * PRIVACY: events and metadata only — never recognised text, never audio.
 * Lengths and byte counts are recorded because "empty vs non-empty" is the
 * question being asked; the content itself never is. Model and engine ids are
 * configuration, not user data. Provider error messages are NOT logged
 * verbatim (they can echo request content); only the exception class name.
