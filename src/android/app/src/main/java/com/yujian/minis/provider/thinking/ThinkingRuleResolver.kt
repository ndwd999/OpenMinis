/**
 * Data-driven replacement for the thinking-parameter if-return chain.

 *  • Covers the OpenAI-compatible family only. Gemini and Anthropic keep their own
 *    emitters; their formats are declared in [ThinkingWireFormat] so the vocabulary is
 *    complete, but nothing resolves to them here. Wiring them in is Phase 2.
 *  • Built-in rules only. No persistence, no user rules, no UI. [ThinkingRule.Kind.CUSTOM]
 *    and [ThinkingWireFormat.CustomPath] exist so Phase 2 need not change these types.
 *  • Behaviour must stay byte-for-byte identical to the pre-refactor chain. That is not an
 *    aspiration — ThinkingWireGoldenSnapshotTest was generated against the old
 *    implementation and committed before this file existed (fdc28e2b).
 *
 * EVALUATION MODEL (design §4), two stages:
 *  Stage A — walk the rules top to bottom, first scope match wins, stop. Ordering is
 *            priority. The PROVIDER_TYPE_DEFAULT at the bottom has AllModels scope so a
 *            match is guaranteed and stage A can never fall through.
 *  Stage B — a matched rule that leaves wireFormat null defers to the fallback chain.
 *            Kept separate from stage A on purpose: cross-rule field merging would make
 *            "why did this value come from there" unanswerable in a trace.
