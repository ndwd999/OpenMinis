// [T-p1-delegate-task] Component B of the sub-agent / scheduled-task design
// (subagent_design_v4 §8.1–8.2), Android port of iOS `AgentJobRegistry`.
//
// The in-process registry for every job that runs a prompt in a session on
// behalf of something that is not the user's own tap: a `delegate_task`
// helper today; `minis-scheduled --target child-of-current` and background
// helpers in P2.
//
// Deliberately SEPARATE from `ScheduledTaskStore`. That store is persisted
// (AlarmManager tasks must survive a process kill); this one is not, on
// purpose — a helper's whole life is inside its parent turn, and the parent
// message's tool block is the durable record of what happened. Folding both
// into one table would either strand ephemeral helper rows on disk or drop
// the persistence the alarms need. The two share only the trigger/target
// vocabulary and the CLI contract (§8.3).
//
// No `kind` field (§8.2): purpose is expressed by `trigger` + `target`, and
// "is this a helper" is `target is ChildOfCurrent`.
//
// Intentionally different from iOS: there is no loop-end NotificationCenter
// observer. iOS needs one because its headless runs finish on a detached vm
// and the only signal is a notification that is (bug, noted in the P0
// review) only posted for non-active sessions. On Android the runner holds
// the child ViewModel and awaits its `isStreaming` flow directly, so job
// closure is explicit and does not depend on which session is on screen.
//
// Threading: all mutation happens on the main thread (callers are the agent
// loop's Main hops, Compose, and the RPC layer's Main dispatch). Reads via the
// StateFlow are safe from anywhere.
