/**
 * [T-android-session-private-mounts] The ONE place a shell's `/var/minis`
 * bind mounts are decided — for the agent's shells (ExecutionCoordinator →
 * PersistentShell / FreshProcessShell) and the interactive terminal alike.
 *
 * Why this exists: each chat session has its own `workspace`, `attachments`,
 * `offloads` and `browser` directories, but they used to be ALSO written into
 * the process-global [PRootKernel.bindMounts] every time a shell was built.
 * That map is last-writer-wins, so whichever session built a shell most
 * recently decided what `/var/minis/workspace` meant for every reader of the
 * global map — including the interactive terminal, which replayed it
 * verbatim and so showed a random session's files. The per-session mounts
 * now live only in the argv of the shell that owns them; the global map keeps
 * only what is genuinely global (`memory`, `skills`, `shared`, `mcp-servers`,
 * `mounts/<name>`).
 *
 * A directory that cannot be created is left OUT of the mounts, with an error
 * log, rather than passed through. PRoot does not fail on a missing `-b` host
 * path — it prints one WARNING and silently drops the binding — so the guest
 * would see the empty rootfs placeholder and "successfully" write files that
 * no reader will ever find. Deciding here makes the loss observable.
