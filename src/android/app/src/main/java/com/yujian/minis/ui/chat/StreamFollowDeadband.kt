/**
 * [T-android-stream-follow-deadband] Should the streaming auto-follow act on
 * this position sample, or sit this one out?
 *
 * The streaming follow loop glides the viewport toward the bottom whenever the
 * growing message pushes it away. The distance it chases is
 * `firstVisibleItemIndex * avgItemSize + firstVisibleItemScrollOffset`, and that
 * number does not only GROW — a line can get SHORTER after it was already laid
 * out, because inline markdown re-measures as it streams:
 *
 *   `` `applicationId` `` arrives one character at a time. Until the closing
 *   backtick lands, parseInline renders it as plain text; the moment it lands
 *   the span becomes an inline-code chip with its own padding and a monospace
 *   face, and the line's measured height changes.
 *
 * Measured from a user report (2026-09-02, three frames 17s apart): the viewport
 * moved -18px, then +8px — up, then back down — while a whole line of new text
 * was arriving. Content that only ever grows cannot move the viewport DOWN; the
 * reversal was the re-measure landing mid-glide, and the follow loop dutifully
 * "corrected" for it. That correction is the visible jitter.
 *
 * The rule: while the stream is actively growing, ignore a SMALL reversal for a
 * short settle window. Anything larger, or anything still present after the
 * window, is treated as a real layout change and followed normally.
 *
 * Deliberately amplitude-based rather than component-based. We cannot ask "was
 * that an image?" from here, and we should not try: a text reflow is bounded by
 * roughly one line, while an image/table/code-block settling its height moves
 * hundreds of pixels. One threshold separates them without enumerating widget
 * types, so a future widget needs no new case.
