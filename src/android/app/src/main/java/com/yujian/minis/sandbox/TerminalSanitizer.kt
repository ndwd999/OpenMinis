     * character, so whatever the previous content had BEYOND the new
     * segment's length stays visible — `"AAAA\rBB"` renders as `"BBAA"`,

     * its old tail. Keeping only the last non-empty segment (the behavior

     * was shorter. Empty segments (a trailing \r, or \r\r) move the cursor
     * without writing, so they are no-ops.

     * [T-android-sanitize-cr-escapes] Escape sequences are ZERO-width here.
     * The fold used to run on the raw text, before escape stripping, so the
     * invisible bytes counted as screen columns: `Downloading 50%\r\e[KDone`
     * (pip / npm / apk / git progress) rendered as "Doneding 50%" because
     * ESC[K was treated as 3 printable chars instead of "erase to end of
     * line", and a coloured segment overwritten by a plain one kept the old
     * visible text while the overwrite landed on the colour codes. Lines with
     * a \r are now simulated cursor-wise: escapes are consumed without
     * advancing the cursor, EL (ESC[K / ESC[1K / ESC[2K) is interpreted, and
     * other control bytes (which pass 3 deletes anyway) take no column.
     * Lines without \r are untouched; pass 2 strips their escapes as before.
     *
     * O(line length): every char is visited once.
