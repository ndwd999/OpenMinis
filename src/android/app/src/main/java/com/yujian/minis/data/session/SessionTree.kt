 * [T-android-child-session-delete-storage] Parent/child session tree helpers.

 * Helper (delegate_task) sessions are hidden children of the session that
 * spawned them (`ChatSessionEntity.parentSessionId`). Every operation that
 * treats a session as a unit — delete, storage accounting, cache release —
 * has to cover the whole subtree, not one level: a child can itself have
 * children in a later design, and hardcoding one hop is exactly the bug
 * class this exists to prevent. These are pure functions over an id graph so
 * the walk is unit-testable without Room.
