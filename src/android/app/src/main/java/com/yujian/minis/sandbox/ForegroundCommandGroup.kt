/**
 * [T-android-shell-timeout-pgid] How a foreground command is isolated so a
 * timeout can kill it — and only it.
 *
 * Issue #358: one command that outran its timeout wedged its whole session.
 * Every later `shell_execute` in that session timed out too, `echo alive`
 * included, while other sessions and the interactive Terminal stayed fine.
 *
 * Cause: the timeout path did exactly nothing to the runaway.
 *
 *     // Timeout — cancel pending, but don't kill the shell
 *     pendingCallback = null
 *
 * The command kept running inside the session's long-lived, REUSED shell,
 * still writing to stdout. `/bin/sh` reads stdin serially, so the next
 * command merely queued behind it and could not start until the runaway
 * finished — which is why even `echo alive` burned its full timeout.
 *
 * ## Why a process group, and not a string search for `&`
 *
 * The obvious-looking fix — "if the command contains `&`, treat it as a
 * background job and leave it alone" — is wrong in a way that is hard to see
 * and easy to ship. `&` is ordinary text in `curl 'a?x=1&y=2'`, in
 * `grep 'a & b'`, in `awk '{print $1 & $2}'`, and inside any heredoc. A
 * matcher cannot tell those from a real job-control `&` without parsing the
 * whole shell grammar, quoting and all. Getting it wrong either kills a
 * daemon the user deliberately started, or spares a runaway and leaves #358
 * unfixed.
 *
 * The kernel already tracks exactly this, so ask it instead. Each foreground
 * command runs under `setsid`, which puts it in a brand-new session and
 * process group whose pgid equals its pid. Verified in this project's own
 * Alpine guest (`/proc/<pid>/stat` field 5):
 *
 *     shell           pid=23997  pgid=946     <- the persistent shell
 *     setsid child    pid=24027  pgid=24027   <- its own group
 *     plain child     pid=24029  pgid=946     <- inherits the shell's
 *
 * Timeout then sends `kill -9 -<pgid>`, which reaches that command and its
 * descendants and nothing else.
 *
 * ## Protecting real background work
 *
 * A `&` job started inside the wrapper still inherits the wrapper's group —
 * measured directly: `bg_pgid=24041` against `fg_pgid=24041` — so a plain
 * `sleep 100 &` WOULD be swept up. That is the correct call: an unadorned `&`
 * job belongs to the command that spawned it, and the user asked for that
 * command to stop.
 *
 * Work that is meant to outlive the command says so, by detaching into its
 * own session with `setsid` or `nohup`. Measured on device, killing the
 * foreground group:
 *
 *     plain `… &` daemon   : frozen at 2 lines  (swept, as intended)
 *     `setsid …` daemon    : 6 -> 9 lines       (survived)
 *
 * So the rule the user gets is the standard POSIX one, enforced by the
 * kernel rather than by a regex over their command text.

     * [T-android-shell-fresh-process] Step 4: the same process-group
     * isolation, for a path that has no marker protocol.
     *
     * The fresh-process path already learns completion from `waitFor()`, so it
     * needs none of [wrap]'s marker machinery — only the property that makes a
     * timeout killable: the command must lead its own process group.
     *
     * Why it is needed there at all. `Process.destroyForcibly()` SIGKILLs the
     * proot process it spawned, but not the guest descendants proot is
     * tracing. Measured on a Pixel 6: proot died on schedule at 5s
     * (`timeout after 5s, process killed` in logcat) while a `libproot.so`
     * child survived holding the pipe's write end, so the host's blocking
     * read never saw EOF and the call outlived its deadline. Killing the
     * GROUP reaches those descendants, the last writer closes, and the read
     * ends naturally.
     *
     * `exec` matters here: without it the wrapping `sh` would remain as an
     * extra process between the group leader and the work, and would be the
     * one to die while the real command kept the pipe open. With it the
     * command IS the group leader.
     *
     * [T-android-fresh-exit-status-file] The group leader is now a small
     * runner ([FRESH_RUNNER]) rather than the command itself, because process
     * exit stopped being a usable completion signal: a command that leaves a
     * detached daemon behind (every cold `minis-mcp-cli` call) keeps proot
     * alive — proot must keep tracing the daemon for its paths to work — and
     * proot's own stdout is the host pipe, so the read never reaches EOF. The
     * runner records its pid (= the group id, since setsid made it the leader)
     * in `<statusPath>.pid`, runs the command in a child shell, then writes
     * the command's exit status to `<statusPath>` and exits with it. The
     * status file is the completion signal; the pid file lets a timeout or
     * Stop kill exactly this command's group and nothing it deliberately
     * detached.
     *
     * The command and the path stay separate argv entries — `$1` and `$2` of
     * the runner — so nothing in either is ever re-parsed by a shell.
