/**
 * [T-android-context-overflow-selfheal] (GH#352) Recognises the one provider
 * error a session cannot recover from on its own.
 *
 * When a request exceeds the model's context window the provider answers
 * `[400] maximum context length is 1048576 … requested ≈1090600 tokens`, and
 * because the offending content is already persisted in the session's history
 * the SAME request is rebuilt on every retry and every fallback model. The
 * session is wedged permanently; the reporter's only workaround was starting a
 * new chat.
 *
 * Compaction does not save it either: the content that overflowed is usually a
 * single oversized part, and compaction summarises text — it does not remove
 * the one part that is 100x everything else combined.
 *
 * So this is matched narrowly and acted on narrowly. It is matched on TEXT,
 * which is normally unreliable, but here the consequences are bounded in both
 * directions and there is no alternative signal:
 *
 *   - false positive: one oversized part is offloaded to disk and replaced by
 *     a stub naming the file. The content is not lost and the turn proceeds.
 *   - false negative: today's behaviour, unchanged.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT matched on status alone. A bare 400 covers malformed JSON,
 * content policy, unknown parameters — none of which offloading would fix, and
 * silently mutating history for them would be worse than the error.
