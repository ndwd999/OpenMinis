/**
 * [T-android-session-grouping] The `folder_id` index is declared here so the
 * entity and MIGRATION_10_11 agree — Room validates the live schema against
 * the entity on open, and an index present in one but not the other aborts
 * startup with an IllegalStateException.
 *
 * Non-unique on purpose: many sessions share one group.
 *
 * [T-android-moveto-perf] `updated_at` is indexed for the same
 * entity-must-match-migration reason, paired with MIGRATION_13_14. Every
 * session listing orders by it (`ORDER BY updated_at DESC`), which without an
 * index degrades to a full scan plus a sort as the table grows — the "Move to"
 * sheet's visible loading pause.
 *
 * Ascending, not DESC: Room's Index annotation emits a plain
 * `CREATE INDEX … ON sessions(updated_at)` and validates the live schema
 * against exactly that string. Declaring DESC in the migration would not match
 * what Room expects and would abort startup. SQLite walks a B-tree index in
 * either direction, so an ascending index serves ORDER BY … DESC fine.
