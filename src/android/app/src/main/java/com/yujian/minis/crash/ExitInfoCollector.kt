/**
 * [OpenMinis#363] Recover the PREVIOUS process death from the system, after
 * the fact.
 *
 * The problem this exists for: a native SIGABRT kills the process outright, so
 * nothing in-process gets to describe it. debuggerd does write a tombstone —
 * carrying the "Abort message:" line and a full memory map — but it lands in
 * `/data/tombstones/`, which an app cannot read (SELinux, owner `system`), and
 * which a user cannot fetch without adb. Field reports therefore arrived as a
 * handful of bare PCs with no abort message and no way to tell which .so they
 * belonged to.
 *
 * `ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons()` is the supported way
 * out: querying your OWN package needs no permission, and for a
 * [ApplicationExitInfo.REASON_CRASH_NATIVE] record the platform hands back
 *
 *   - [ApplicationExitInfo.getDescription] — the abort message, and
 *   - [ApplicationExitInfo.getTraceInputStream] — the WHOLE tombstone,
 *     memory map included, which is what turns a raw PC into "libfoo.so+0x…".
 *
 * Output goes to `filesDir/logs/exitinfo-<stamp>.log`, the same directory and
 * `.log` extension [CrashFileSender] and the native handler already use, so it
 * shows up in LogManagementScreen and the user can export it without adb.
 *
 * Runs once per process start, off the main thread, and only for records newer
 * than the high-water mark it persists — so a device that keeps the same exit
 * record for weeks does not re-write the same file on every launch.
