/**
 * [T-android-payload-size-audit] (GH#352) A byte-side cross-check on the
 * token-side estimate, for the one case where the two disagree catastrophically.
 *
 * Why this exists. Two budgets guard the outgoing request and they are
 * denominated differently:
 *
 *   - [com.yujian.minis.provider.ImageBudget] counts BYTES (25 MB request cap).
 *   - [BPETokenizer.countImageTokens] counts TOKENS, using the vision grid-tile
 *     heuristic — area / 32², a few thousand tokens for a large photo.
 *
 * Both are right when an image travels as a structured `image_url` block: a
 * 1 MB photo really is ~1-3k tokens to a vision model, and 1.37 MB of base64 is
 * nowhere near 25 MB. But if that same image is measured as TEXT anywhere
 * downstream, its true cost is ~960k tokens — and no gate in the app sees that,
 * because every gate is looking at a number three orders of magnitude smaller.
 *
 * Field report (GH#352): a 1,030,449-byte PNG produced
 * `[400] maximum context length is 1048576 … requested ≈10906xx tokens`, and
 * the reporter's own A/B measured the same image at 267 tokens via image_url
 * and 959,936 tokens via a text channel. Nothing in this codebase encodes an
 * image as text (every emit site uses `image_url` / `input_image`), so the
 * mismatch is believed to arise downstream — but the app's inability to NOTICE
 * it is ours, and that is what this fixes.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately a ratio, not a fixed ceiling. A fixed byte cap would
 * have to be tuned per provider and would fire on legitimately large requests;
 * a ratio only fires when the two measurements disagree by so much that one of
 * them must be wrong. Normal content cannot trip it: prose is ~3.5 bytes per
 * token, JSON tool input maybe 6-8, so even pathological text stays far under
 * [SUSPICIOUS_BYTES_PER_TOKEN]. Base64 image bytes measured against a
 * grid-tile token estimate land around 500-800 bytes/token.
