/**
 * [T-android-fresh-stderr-drain] Keeps a command's separate stderr pipe
 * flowing, and decides where each line goes.
 *
 * Debug builds (BuildConfig.DEV_TOOLS) spawn the fresh-process shell with
 * stderr NOT merged into stdout, so proot's `[native_offload]` debug lines
 * can go to logcat instead of into the command's output. The fresh path
 * copied that split from PersistentShell but not PersistentShell's stderr
 * reader thread, so nothing read the pipe at all. Once a command wrote 64 KB
 * to stderr — wget's progress meter on a ~40 MB download, pip, npm, a
 * compiler — the pipe buffer filled and the command blocked in write()
 * forever, with the download stalled mid-file. Observed on a Pixel 6: wget in
 * `pipe_write` for 10+ minutes, zero bytes read or written over a 10 s
 * sample, the .part file frozen at 42.9 MB. Release builds merge stderr and
 * were never affected.
 *
 * Lines are routed the way a release build would show them: our proot
 * extensions' debug lines (`[native_offload] `, `[fake_netlink] `) go to [log]; every other line is kept and
 * returned by [finish] so the caller can append it to the command output —
 * the model sees the command's errors in debug builds too, not just in
 * release. Stderr is appended after stdout rather than interleaved; the order
 * between the two streams is not recoverable once they are separate pipes.
