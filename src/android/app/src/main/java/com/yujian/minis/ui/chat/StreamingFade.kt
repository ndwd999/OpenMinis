/**
 * [T-android-stream-fade] Word-level fade-in for streamed markdown text.
 *
 * Mirror of iOS TextFadeAnimator: newly appended characters render at α=0
 * and ease to α=1 over [FADE_DURATION_MS], with a small staggered delay
 * across word boundaries so the appearance reads as "words landing in
 * sequence" rather than "a single block flashing on". Only the streaming
 * last block opts in via [LocalAppendOnlyFade]; everything else (history,
 * cold-loaded sessions, completed messages) renders fully opaque.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *  - Each MdText with the local set to true holds a [FadeController] that
 *    tracks the previous plainText prefix. When the new plainText extends
 *    that prefix, the suffix gets sliced into word ranges, each tagged with
 *    a (startTimeNanos, staggerOffsetMs) pair.
 *  - A single `withFrameNanos` loop in the composable advances animation
 *    progress and writes the current alpha to a snapshot-state map. The
 *    MdText reads that map ONLY from a draw lambda ([forEachActive]) that
 *    paints a background-coloured mask over each fading word inside its own
 *    graphics layer. Composition never reads it, so a frame costs a few
 *    small paths — not a recomposition, not a paragraph re-layout.
 *
 *    [T-android-stream-fade-relayout] It used to be consumed in composition:
 *    `overlay()` rebuilt the whole AnnotatedString with per-word alpha spans
 *    every frame, which made `Text` re-lay-out and re-record the ENTIRE live
 *    paragraph per vsync. Measured on a Pixel 4a: record(draw) 8→18 ms as the
 *    live block grew from 2k to 8k chars, ~93 % of frames over budget for the
 *    whole stream — the fade (350 ms + 300 ms stagger) never went idle between
 *    500 ms publishes, so this was the steady state, not a burst.
 *  - When all ranges reach α=1 the loop suspends until a new append
 *    arrives, keeping idle cost at zero.
 *  - A guard caps the in-flight word count: bursts beyond [MAX_FADE_WORDS]
 *    are emitted fully opaque instead, matching iOS's TextFadeAnimator
 *    `maxAnimatedWords = 160` short-circuit so a 1k-token reflow can't
 *    saturate the frame budget.
