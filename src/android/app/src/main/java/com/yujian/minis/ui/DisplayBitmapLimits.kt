/**
 * [T-android-canvas-large-bitmap-crash] Decode-size ceiling for images we hand
 * to Compose / Canvas for DISPLAY.
 *
 * Background: a markdown attachment (`telecom_whole_market.png`, a very tall
 * chart) crashed on a vivo V2454DA / Android 16 with
 *
 *     java.lang.RuntimeException: Canvas: trying to draw too large(215040000bytes) bitmap
 *       at android.graphics.RecordingCanvas.throwIfCannotDraw
 *
 * 215,040,000 bytes / 4 (ARGB_8888) = 53.76 Mpx — e.g. a ~3000x17920 chart.
 * `RecordingCanvas` refuses any bitmap above roughly 100MB (the exact ceiling
 * tracks the GPU's max texture dimension), so the draw throws and takes the
 * process down from `ThreadedRenderer.draw`.
 *
 * Why it got that big: the markdown image renderer used
 * `SubcomposeAsyncImage(model = file, contentScale = ContentScale.FillWidth)`
 * with NO `ImageRequest` size. Coil sizes a request from the layout
 * constraints, but the markdown column is vertically scrollable, so the height
 * constraint is `Constraints.Infinity`. With an unbounded dimension Coil falls
 * back to the image's INTRINSIC size and decodes the PNG at full resolution.
 * A wide-but-short image survives that (width is bounded); a very tall one does
 * not.
 *
 * The fix caps the decode instead of scaling after the fact: capping at the
 * `ImageRequest` level means the giant bitmap is never allocated, which also
 * removes the OOM risk that a decode-then-downscale approach would keep.
 *
 * This is a DISPLAY-side guard only. It is unrelated to
 * [com.yujian.minis.provider.ImageBudget], which caps bytes sent to LLM
 * providers on the network path.
