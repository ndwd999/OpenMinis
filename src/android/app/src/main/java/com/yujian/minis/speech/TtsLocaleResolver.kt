/**
 * [T-android-tts-locale GH#324] Decides which [Locale] the system TTS engine
 * should speak a given piece of text in.
 *
 * ## The bug this replaces
 *
 * `TextToSpeechManager.autoDetectAndSetLanguage` was a two-way branch:
 *
 * ```
 * val locale = if (HAN_REGEX.containsMatchIn(text)) SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE else Locale.US
 * ```
 *
 * Han characters got Chinese; **everything else got US English**. Spanish,
 * German, French, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Croatian and every other shipped
 * language was read aloud by an American English voice, which for es/de/hr is
 * not an accent but genuinely unintelligible. Reported as GH#324.
 *
 * Critically, that branch ran on EVERY utterance and consulted nothing but the
 * text's script — not the app's UI language, not the system locale. So no
 * amount of localisation work could fix it: shipping `values-es` changes which
 * strings the UI renders, and changes nothing about which voice speaks them.
 *
 * ## Why the UI language is the DEFAULT, and not text detection
 *
 * Reliable natural-language identification needs a real model (ML Kit's
 * language-id, or similar); this project has no such dependency and adding one
 * to pick a TTS voice would be disproportionate. More importantly, statistical
 * detection is least reliable exactly where TTS needs it most — short replies
 * ("Vale.", "Danke!", "OK") carry almost no signal, and a wrong guess is the
 * same disaster we are fixing.
 *
 * Script is different: it is decidable from the characters themselves with no
 * model and no ambiguity, so scripts that identify a language (Han, Kana,
 * Hangul, Cyrillic, Greek, Thai, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari) are honoured
 * first. For Latin script — where es/de/fr/hr/pt/… are mutually
 * indistinguishable without a model — the best available evidence is the
 * language the user chose for the app, which is also what they are almost
 * certainly reading and conversing in.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: no Android types, so it is unit-testable.
