/**
 * [T-android-provider-voice] Voice-modality helpers — the Android port of the
 * iOS ModelModality voice-shape conventions (LLMTypes.swift).
 *
 * iOS models modality as one OptionSet; Android as two String lists
 * (inputModalities / outputModalities, bare names — see normalizeModalities()).
 * The cross-platform shape conventions are:
 *
 *   - Dedicated ASR model  = audio in → text out   (iOS [.audioInput, .textOutput])
 *   - Dedicated TTS model  = text in → audio out   (iOS [.textInput, .audioOutput])
 *   - TEMPLATE SEED        = exactly ONE audio flag and nothing else:
 *       ASR seed → inputs == ["audio"], outputs == null
 *       TTS seed → inputs == null,      outputs == ["audio"]
 *
 * The single-flag seed shape is the [T-voice-seed-shape-exact] discriminator:
 * no API-derived model is ever a single audio flag (inference and the models
 * APIs always attach the paired text side), so launch cleanup can safely
 * remove retired seeds by this exact shape without ever touching API models.
