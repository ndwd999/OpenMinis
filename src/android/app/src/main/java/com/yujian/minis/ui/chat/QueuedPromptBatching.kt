/**
 * [T-scheduled-preemptive-insert] Which queued prompts go out together, and
 * when.
 *
 * Two delivery points exist. The TOOL BOUNDARY — a turn's tool calls have all
 * finished and their results are in history, the next model request has not
 * been made — is where a prompt can be slipped into a running loop without
 * cutting any tool short. The DRAIN runs once the loop has converged (and
 * after a Stop).
 *
 * The rules, and why:
 *  - A scheduled fire always travels ALONE. It carries its own envelope and
 *    possibly its own prefilled tool call; merged with other prompts it
 *    became one message holding several unrelated triggers, and a prefill
 *    had no single turn to belong to.
 *  - At the tool boundary only a user follow-up or a scheduled fire may go
 *    in. Other programmatic prompts (agent callbacks, RPC/CLI sends) keep
 *    waiting for the drain, as [QueuedPromptOrigin] describes.
 *  - One scheduled fire per boundary. Several pending fires are delivered one
 *    boundary (or drain round) at a time, oldest first, so the original task
 *    still gets a model turn between them.
 *  - Non-scheduled prompts keep their old behaviour: merged into one message.
