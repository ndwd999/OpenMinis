// T283 — native crash → file (NDK signal handler).
//
// Registered at app startup from MinisApp.onCreate via JNI. Catches
// fatal signals raised inside JNI / proot / pty_bridge / any other
// native code, writes a one-shot text report to the configured logs
// dir, then hands the signal to the handler that was installed before
// us — debuggerd — so the system tombstone is also generated and the
// app exits like normal.
//
// [T-android-crash-observability] That last step used to be
// `signal(sig, SIG_DFL); raise(sig)`, and the comment claimed it let
// Android "still produce a tombstone". It does not. A tombstone is
// written by debuggerd's OWN signal handler, which lives inside this
// process and which our sigaction() call replaced. Resetting to
// SIG_DFL and re-raising therefore skips debuggerd entirely: the
// kernel just applies the default action and kills us. No tombstone,
// no backtrace, and — worst of all — no "Abort message:" line, which
// for a SIGABRT is the single most useful field there is.
//
// The observable result was two user crash reports nine hours apart
// that both said only "SIGABRT, si_code=-1, self-abort" with nothing
// to act on, while /data/tombstones/ held no matching entry. We were
// eating the evidence for the crash we were trying to diagnose.
//
// Two changes fix that:
//   1. Save the previous handler per signal and CHAIN to it instead of
//      SIG_DFL, so debuggerd runs and writes the real tombstone.
//   2. Write a small unwound backtrace into our own summary, so the
//      file the user can actually find and send (app logs dir) carries
//      frame addresses even when nobody can fetch the tombstone.
//
// Strict async-signal-safety: only signal-safe libc calls inside the
// handler (open/write/close/snprintf are safe; printf/malloc are not).
// Neither _Unwind_Backtrace nor dladdr() is on POSIX's async-signal-safe
// list, so both are called only after the summary text is already
// written and only on the first entry into the handler — a hang or
// fault inside either can no longer cost us the report, at worst only
// the backtrace section appended below it.

// A raw PC is an ASLR'd absolute address: it is meaningless outside the

// acted on at all without the matching tombstone — and the tombstone is
// exactly the thing users usually cannot fetch (it needs adb, and on
// most retail devices root or a full bugreport). Field reports were
// therefore arriving as seven bare hex numbers, and every one of them
// had to be answered with "please run adb bugreport" before triage
// could even begin — see the 2026-09-10 voice-input crash, where the
// only thing derivable from the summary was how the addresses grouped
// by load base.
//
// dladdr() turns each PC into "which .so, how far in", and the offset
// is stable across runs because it is relative to the library's own
// load base. That is enough to name the faulting library immediately,
// and enough to feed `llvm-addr2line -e <lib>.so <offset>` directly —
// no tombstone, no memory map, no symbol server.
//
// Async-signal-safety: dladdr() takes the loader lock and is not on
// POSIX's async-signal-safe list. That is the same trade-off this file
// already accepts for _Unwind_Backtrace (see the header note), and it
// is safe for the same structural reason: this runs only AFTER the
// summary text is already on disk and only on first entry into the
// handler, so a hang or fault inside it costs at most the backtrace
// section — never the report. Deadlock is possible only if we crashed
// while already holding the loader lock (i.e. inside dlopen); in that

// ── [OpenMinis#363] Abort message capture ───────────────────────────────
//
// For a SIGABRT the single most useful field is the message the aborting
// code passed to abort — "Scudo ERROR: invalid chunk state", a libc
// assertion text, an ART runtime reason. It is what debuggerd prints as
// "Abort message:" in the tombstone. This handler used to write a
// paragraph telling the reader where to go looking for it and never read
// it itself, so the one file a user can actually retrieve (the app's own
// logs dir) carried everything EXCEPT the reason. Three crashes in 24h
// were filed with nothing to act on.
//
// Captured two ways, best-effort, in this order:
//
//   1. __android_log_set_aborter() — the supported hook, resolved with
//      dlsym because minSdk here is 26 and the symbol is __INTRODUCED_IN(30).
//      liblog calls it with the message just before aborting, on the
//      aborting thread, BEFORE the signal is raised, and we copy the string
//      into a static buffer.
//
//      Narrower than it sounds: liblog documents this as the aborter for
//      __android_log_assert() failures, so it catches LOG_ALWAYS_FATAL and
//      friends — NOT a bare abort(), and not Scudo. The API returns void,
//      so there is no previous aborter to chain to; we deliberately do not
//      abort ourselves, leaving liblog's own "highly recommended to abort"
//      contract to the caller, which is what it did before we hooked it.
//
//   2. dlsym("__abort_message") — bionic's own global, which is what
//      debuggerd reads and what android_set_abort_message() fills in. NOT a
//      public ABI: the struct layout could change between releases, so every
//      step is bounds- and null-checked and any surprise yields "no message"
//      rather than a fault. This is the path that covers plain abort(),
//      Scudo and ART aborts, i.e. most of what we actually see.
//
// Neither path helps for a runtime that aborts without going through
// bionic's abort message at all — notably the Go runtime in libgojni.so,
// whose panics simply raise SIGABRT. For those the fallback advice text
// below is still the right output, which is why it is kept rather than
// replaced.
