/**
 * [M15] The THREE-WAY BRANCH in `ThinkingRuleResolver.geminiThinkingConfig`:
 * gemini-3.x (thinkingLevel) / 2.5-pro (budget, floor 128) / 2.5-flash (budget,
 * floor 0) — and the two ids that must fall out of it entirely, 2.5-flash-lite
 * and the specialized modalities.
 *
 * Pins d5d2aaba4 / 2881f9cbf (3.7+ Flash rejects thinkingLevel "minimal" and
 * must floor at "low") and 4b6121833 / GH#226 (a TTS id gets no thinking config
 * and no systemInstruction — both are hard 400s).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE, given ThinkingWireGeminiAnthropicSnapshotTest exists: the
 * snapshot is a value oracle over a fixed id list. It cannot state the STRUCTURAL
 * invariants, and those are where this function's bugs have actually come from:
 *
 *  • SUBSTRING COLLAPSE. `"gemini-2.5-flash-lite".contains("gemini-2.5-flash")`
 *    is true, so the flash branch would claim flash-lite if the guards were
 *    ordered or written differently. The snapshot records "flash-lite → null"
 *    but says nothing about which of the two mechanisms keeps it there, so a
 *    refactor can delete the `!contains("lite")` guard and re-add the null
 *    through an unrelated path with every row intact.
 *  • PRECEDENCE. A TTS id also matches a family pattern
 *    (`gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` contains "gemini-3"), so the suffix check
 *    is only correct BECAUSE it runs first. Both platforms shipped that check
 *    below the family branches at some point, where it was dead code.
 *  • MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY. Three overlapping `contains` predicates over one id is
 *    exactly the shape that silently double-matches.
 *
 * So these tests assert relationships between ids rather than values per id, and
 * add a source-grep guard on the guards themselves.
