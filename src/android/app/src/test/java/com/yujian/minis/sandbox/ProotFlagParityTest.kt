/**
 * [T-android-fake-netlink-tty-parity] The two ways into the sandbox must build
 * the same proot command.
 *
 * There are two builders, and they are easy to edit in isolation:
 *   - `PRootKernel.buildProotCommand` — the agent's shell_execute / offload
 *     path, non-interactive, plain pipes.
 *   - `TerminalSession.buildInteractiveCommand` — the Terminal screen, a real
 *     PTY via PtyBridge.
 *
 * c9318f42f added `--fake-netlink` to the first one only. The sandbox then
 * behaved differently depending on which screen the command was launched
 * from: a tool run by the agent got proot's emulated (empty) rtnetlink reply,
 * while the same tool typed into the Terminal hit the real AF_NETLINK refusal
 * from Android's untrusted_app SELinux domain. That asymmetry is invisible
 * from either screen alone and makes any field report ambiguous — the first
 * question becomes "which shell did you use?".
 *
 * These are source-fact checks: both builders assemble an argv for a native
 * binary that cannot run in a JVM test, so what is verifiable here is that the
 * isolation-affecting flags stay in step.
