/**
 * [M17 / M14 / M18] The OFF-tier ALLOWLIST and the rule-chain ORDER — the two
 * decisions that together choose what a "thinking off" request looks like.
 *
 * Pins ff60c818a (the allowlist itself), c5efeb1ed (MiMo/Agnes strict-enum
 * exemption — "minimal" killed the whole request), 4a89f5caf / 72968c4f2 (match
 * the mimo FAMILY, not one spelling: the live API serves `mimo-v2.5` while the
 * docs say `mimo-2.5`), 866387d63 (the unified-gateway rule must sit BELOW the
 * OpenAI-native and qwen rules, never above), 466b00f9b / 68fb961eb (GH#356,
 * `deepseek-flash` is a sibling rule, not a widened scope), and 3ba3eb5c0 /
 * 36420f1d2 (GH#163, an affirmatively empty tier list on first-party xAI omits
 * the field).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE, given ThinkingWireGoldenSnapshotTest already pins values: a
 * snapshot pins WHAT goes out, not WHY. Its rows are the visible surface of two
 * orthogonal mechanisms — a caller-side allowlist (`explicitOffEffort`, which
 * decides whether there IS an off tier) and a resolver-side dispatch (which of
 * OpenAI-native / self-reasoning-family / everyone-else branch consumes it).
 * A refactor can move a decision from one to the other and reproduce every
 * snapshot row while destroying the reason. These tests name the mechanism, so
 * they fail at the point the reasoning breaks rather than at the point a value
 * happens to change.
 *
 * Two seams, deliberately:
 *  • [ThinkingRuleResolver.apply] directly, for the OFF dispatch and the chain
 *    order — that is a pure function and the honest place to assert precedence.
 *  • the real [OpenAIProvider] request body, for the allowlist — it is derived
 *    from the base URL by a private member, so the body is the only seam that
 *    proves the URL predicate and the resolver agree.

     * WAS A KNOWN GAP — found while writing this file, FIXED in production by

     *
     * GH#163's skip ("the catalog affirmatively declares no effort tiers, so omit
     * `reasoning_effort`") is implemented in the ENABLED branch of
     * `ThinkingWireFormat.ReasoningEffort` only. The OFF branch is a separate
     * early-returning dispatch placed ABOVE it, and none of its three arms
     * consults `declaresNoEffortTiers`. So an xAI model that answers the field
     * with
     *   400 "Model grok-build-0.1 does not support parameter reasoningEffort"
     * receives that field anyway the moment an off tier exists — i.e. turning
     * thinking OFF is the one way to put the 400-triggering parameter back on the
     * wire, which inverts the user's intent in the most confusing possible
     * direction ("it only breaks when I turn thinking off").
     *
     * REACHABILITY (as it stood before the fix). It needed `offEffort != null` on a first-party xAI endpoint,
     * and `explicitOffEffort()` returns null for api.x.ai today — official OpenAI
     * and Ark/seed/doubao are the only allowlist members — so this is LATENT, not
     * a live field bug. It becomes live if xAI is ever added to the allowlist
     * (plausible: the commit notes widening it is "a one-line change backed by new
     * evidence"), or for a grok id served from an Ark-shaped base, where the
     * family half of the allowlist supplies "minimal" while `isXAI` is false —
     * that combination is already excluded by the unified-gateway exemption, so
     * the allowlist is the realistic trigger.
     *
     * FIX APPLIED: the `isXAI && !usesUnifiedReasoningEffort &&
     * declaresNoEffortTiers && !declaresEffort` guard now sits ABOVE the
     * `if (!ctx.level.isEnabled)` block, so one check governs both paths — which
     * also removes the possibility of the two drifting apart again. "The model
     * does not accept this parameter" is a property of the model, not of the
     * requested level, so it must outrank the level dispatch.
