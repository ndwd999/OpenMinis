/**
 * [T-android-table-row-uniform-height] [T-android-table-cell-font-body-size]
 *
 * Reported on a Pixel 4a (2026-09-24, screenshot): in a chat table the first
 * column's row borders sat ~8px lower than the other columns', and every
 * vertical divider broke into offset segments at each row. The table text
 * was also visibly smaller than the reply around it.
 *
 * - Each cell paints its own right/bottom divider from its own size, and a
 *   shorter cell was centred in its row, so its lines floated. Cells differ
 *   in height since MdText trims the outer half-leading: a single line is as
 *   tall as its font, and a cell with CJK text (fallback font) is taller than Latin
 *   ("23–32°C").
 * - Cells were a fixed 14.sp against a 16.sp × font-scale body; iOS sets
 *   them in the body size.
 *
 * RenderTable is a Compose Layout, which does not run on the JVM, so its
 * contract is pinned against source; the visual check is on device.
