/**
 * Cross-platform consistency check for the iOS 404 outage introduced by
 * commit `04c80e68e` — Android side.
 *
 * ## The iOS failure
 *
 * `04c80e68e` (fixing issue #368) added a "synthesized reasoning head": when a
 * tool-calling turn had no real reasoning echo to replay, iOS invented a
 * reasoning item and gave it the id `rs_syn_<last 24 of the tool call id>`.
 * Every subsequent request in an affected session then died with
 *
 *     [404] Item with id 'rs_syn_…' not found. Items are not persisted when
 *     store is set to false. Try again with store set to true, or remove this
 *     item from your input
 *
 * reported against Codex OAuth ("OpenAI PLUS (iCloud)"), which is why this
 * test pins that provider shape specifically.
 *
 * The root cause is a category error, not a formatting slip: `rs_…` is a
 * SERVER-OWNED resource key, and these requests send `store: false`, so an id
 * the server never minted is always a dangling reference. iOS measured this
 * against the live endpoint (gpt-5.6-sol, `store:false`):
 *
 *   * synthetic `rs_syn_…` id    → 404  (the reported failure)
 *   * well-formed but foreign id → 404  (so no invented id is "safe")
 *   * NO id, `summary: []`       → 200
 *   * no reasoning item at all   → 200  ← what Android does
 *
 * ## Android's position
 *
 * Android never had the defect. `buildResponsesAPIBody` emits only
 * `function_call`, `function_call_output` and input content blocks; it never
 * constructs a `reasoning` item and never captures an `rs_` id from the
 * stream to replay, so there is nothing to fabricate an id for. Per the last
 * row of the table above, "no reasoning item at all" is a 200.
 *
 * Android does synthesize `fc_syn_…` for `function_call.id` when history
 * arrived without one. That is deliberately NOT the same hazard, and iOS says
 * so explicitly at OpenAIAgentProvider.swift:1888 — `function_call.id` is a
 * per-request label whose real pairing key is `call_id`, whereas `rs_…` is a
 * lookup into server-side storage. This test asserts `fc_syn_` keeps working
 * so a future "remove all synthetic ids" sweep does not over-correct and break
 * replay of Chat-Completions-sourced history.
 *
 * These are wire-body assertions because the wire body is what 404'd. A test
 * that only checked "the call succeeded" would have passed against the bug.
