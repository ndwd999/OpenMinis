/**
 * [T-android-models-refresh-window] Model lists refreshed at most once per
 * CALENDAR DAY, so a model enabled mid-day stayed invisible until the next one.
 *
 * Port of iOS fe625d5fd, reported there with a trace: GitHub turned on
 * gpt-6-astra account-wide during the morning, the app had already refreshed
 * at 09:55, and it made zero further `/models` calls until a manual refresh at
 * 22:20 — which returned it immediately. Nothing was whitelisted; the app
 * simply would not ask again that day.
 *
 * The network call needs a live provider, so what is verifiable here is the
 * gate's arithmetic (which is what was wrong) plus the wiring that decides
 * when it is consulted.
