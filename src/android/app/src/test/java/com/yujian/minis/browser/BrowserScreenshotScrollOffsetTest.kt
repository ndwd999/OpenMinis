/**
 * [T-android-browser-screenshot-scroll-offset] Screenshots must show the part
 * of the page the user is actually looking at.
 *
 * Reported by a user driving the built-in browser: after any scroll, the
 * capture was shifted down by exactly `scrollY` — a blank band on top, the
 * bottom cropped — and once the scroll passed one viewport height the frame
 * came back 100% white. Measured on a Pixel 6 before the fix, at CSS
 * scrollY=300: 788 physical px of white (788 / 2.625 density = 300.2 CSS px,
 * i.e. exactly scrollY) with the Y300 band sitting at viewport y=300 instead
 * of y=0; at the clamped scrollY=1085, 100.0% white with zero non-white
 * sample points.
 *
 * Cause: `captureWebViewBitmap` drew straight into its own Bitmap with
 * `webView.draw(canvas)`. `View.draw(Canvas)` does not compensate scroll —
 * the PARENT does, in `draw(Canvas, ViewGroup, long)` via
 * `canvas.translate(mLeft - sx, mTop - sy)` — so drawing without a parent
 * skips that step entirely.
 *
 * `captureWebViewBitmap` needs a live WebView and a real renderer, so it
 * cannot run on the JVM. These are source-text assertions in the style of
 * `ShellExecutionStrategyTest` / `A11yScreenshotPathTest`, pinning the parts
 * of the contract that a future edit could silently undo. The behavioural
 * proof is the on-device measurement recorded above and in the commit.
