/**
 * Review 2026-09-23 — guards f42128b81 (GH#372, T-android-mcp-slash-dispatch).
 *
 * That fix's own lesson: "If you add another row KIND, give it a flag AND a
 * reader" — the bug was a composer-fill guard that read `isSkill` alone. The
 * ViewModel guard was fixed, but ChatScreen's tap handler has a second
 * composer-fill reader: after `executeSlashCommand` it re-focuses the composer
 * and shows the IME for `cmd.isSkill` only. Tapping an MCP row fills
 * "/<server> " and leaves the keyboard down, unlike a skill row (iOS treats
 * both kinds the same).
 *
 * McpSlashDispatchTest covers the ViewModel; this pins the screen reader.
