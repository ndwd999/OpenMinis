/**
 * [T-android-stream-follow-deadband] The streaming auto-follow must ignore the
 * small backwards step that inline markdown re-measure produces, without going
 * deaf to a real layout change.
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-02: during a long stream the last line kept drifting toward
 * the tool card in uneven steps. Measured from three frames — viewport moved
 * -18px then +8px while a whole new line arrived, which append-only growth
 * cannot produce. Cause: `` `applicationId` `` finished streaming, its closing
 * backtick turned plain text into an inline-code chip, the line re-measured
 * shorter, and the follow loop chased the reversal.
