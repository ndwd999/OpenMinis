/**
 * [M23] The third spelling of a reasoning delta: `delta.reasoning_text`.
 *
 * Pins 317475ab4 / 44e574584, cause #3. GitHub Copilot streams its reasoning as
 * a field name the chat-completions branch had never seen — it accepted
 * `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` only:
 *
 *   "delta":{"content":null,"role":"assistant",
 *            "reasoning_text":" this is a standard mod"}
 *
 * Captured from claude-sonnet-5 via api.githubcopilot.com: 274 such deltas
 * arrived on one turn and every one was discarded (`reasoningLen=0` at stream
 * end). So Deep Thinking was on, the model genuinely reasoned, and the user saw
 * nothing at all. The name already existed elsewhere in the same file for the
 * Responses API (`response.reasoning_text.delta`); only this branch was blind
 * to it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS ALREADY COVERED, and why this file is the remainder. That commit had
 * three independent causes and `CopilotDeviceFlowTest` covers the first two —
 * the `/models` fetch being gated on an api key Copilot does not have, and the
 * capability being read from `supports.thinking`, a key Copilot never sends
 * (it states `adaptive_thinking` / `reasoning_effort` / `max_thinking_budget`
 * instead). Cause #3 is on the STREAM side and had no Android test: the fixes
 * for #1 and #2 only get the request sent correctly, and with #3 outstanding the
 * user still sees an empty thinking pane. Hence a wire-level test.
 *
 * Driven through a real SSE response rather than a parser unit, because the bug
 * was a missing field name in a specific parse branch — the only honest seam is
 * the branch itself.
