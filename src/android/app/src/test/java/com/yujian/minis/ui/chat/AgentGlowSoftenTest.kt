/**
 * [T-android-agent-glow-soften] The sub agent tile's inner glow.
 *
 * Asked for: wider spread, inward rather than clinging to the edge, and a
 * paler purple. The original was a straight port of iOS's 6pt inset stroke at
 * 0.55 alpha; on a 100x65dp tile that read as a hard bright ring around the
 * rim rather than a glow.
 *
 * The draw is inside a @Composable's drawWithContent and this module has no
 * Compose test infrastructure, so the geometry is reproduced here and the
 * production constants are pinned against the source. The arithmetic tests are
 * real — they are what caught both defects that widening the band exposed.
