/**
 * Review 2026-09-23 — source invariants for the sub agent job lifecycle and
 * the queued-prompt hand-off inside ChatViewModel.
 *
 * Guards: af10e3af8 (run summary stamped BEFORE registry.finish, because
 * finish builds the callback synchronously), 06b7ad2e8 + bf74eae2a
 * (RUNNING must be backed by a live job — which only holds if every job is
 * eventually finished), 955e76d6a (mid-task queued message lost across the
 * inject path's suspend points).
 *
 * The functions involved are private suspend members of a ViewModel that
 * needs a Context, Room and a provider, so, like QueuedPromptInjectRaceTest
 * and EvictionGuardTest, the wiring is pinned as source facts. Two of these
 * fail on the current tree and are reported as bugs (see each KDoc).

     * [BUG] `resumeInterruptedChild` (ChatViewModel.kt ~2008-2105) registers a
     * job, marks it RUNNING and submits the resume notice — and then nothing
     * ever calls `registry.finish` for it on the success path. Every other
     * delegation path waits for the child to go idle (wait loop, or
     * startBackgroundHelper's `isStreaming.first { !it }`) and finishes the job.
     *
     * Result for a resumed sub agent that completes normally: the job stays
     * RUNNING for the life of the process — it keeps one of the
     * MAX_CONCURRENT_CHILD_JOBS slots, the parent never receives the final
     * <agent_callback>, the parent reads as `hasWorkInFlight()` forever (so the
     * VM cache can never evict it), and the delegate block keeps its RUNNING
     * spinner because OrphanedRunningToolGate sees a live job — the exact
     * idle-CPU drain 06b7ad2e8 fixed, re-created by a different path.
     *
     * Proposed fix: after submitPrompt succeeds, run the same completion tail
     * as startBackgroundHelper (wait for `isStreaming.first { !it }` with the
     * budget, stamp setSummaryLine, then registry.finish(DONE/FAILED/TIMEOUT)),
     * ideally by routing the resumed run through startBackgroundHelper.

     * (ensureSession, prepareUserAttachments, buildPastedParts,
     * appendMessage) — the same ~5 s window 955e76d6a measured. If the user
     * taps Stop inside that window, streamJob is cancelled at the next
     * suspension; `cancelStream` then finds `_promptQueue` empty, so

     * nor persisted, and its dashed "queued" bubble stays on screen until the
     * session is reopened, where it silently disappears. cancelStream's own
     * contract (T189) is that queued prompts survive a Stop.

     * Proposed fix: take the prompts off the queue only after appendMessage
     * returns, or wrap the persist section in
     * `catch (e: CancellationException) { _promptQueue.value = queued + _promptQueue.value; throw e }`.
