/**
 * [T-android-vm-store-leak] ChatViewModelStore is a process-level cache that
 * had no bound and only one eviction path — release(), called solely when a
 * session is DELETED. Navigating away never dropped anything, so every session
 * opened in a process lifetime stayed resident with its agent history and
 * rendered rows.
 *
 * A device log over ~3 hours recorded ten allocations and zero releases; heap
 * climbed 5% -> 85% of a 512MB cap and RSS to 3.3GB, after which almost every
 * allocation hit a blocking GC (~230/min, 1.4s stalls, 149-frame drops, hot
 * phone).
 *
 * The store is an Android-runtime object this JVM test cannot instantiate, so
 * these pin the invariants as source facts — enough to fail the build if the
 * bound or its two carve-outs are dropped.
