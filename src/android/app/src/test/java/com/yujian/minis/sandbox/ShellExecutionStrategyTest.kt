/**
 * [T-android-shell-fresh-process] Migration off in-band completion markers.
 *
 * Completion has always been detected by appending
 * `echo "__MINIS_DONE_<uuid>_EXIT_$?__"` to every command and scanning stdout
 * for it. That was forced by the warm-shell design: with a REUSED shell,
 * `Process.waitFor()` waits for the shell rather than the command, stdout has
 * no delimiters, and `$?` lives only in the guest.
 *
 * In-band signalling then failed three times in five months — a marker split
 * across two reads (command hung to its timeout), the hold-back buffer added
 * to fix that (every short output swallowed, measured on a Pixel 6), and a
 * timed-out command's bytes landing in the next command's result (#358). The
 * defect is structural: control and data share a channel the command can
 * write to.
 *
 * Measured on a Pixel 6 inside this project's PRoot Alpine guest, 20 runs:
 *
 *     sh -c "echo hi"          4.2 ms
 *     setsid sh -c "echo hi"   8.5 ms
 *     FIFO control round-trip  24.3 ms
 *
 * against 65-90 ms of per-tool-call host overhead. The cold-start objection
 * that motivated warm shells does not survive measurement.
