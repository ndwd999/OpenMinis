/**
 * [T-android-compact-runaway][T-compact-idle-timeout] The ceilings that bound a
 * compaction run.
 *
 * Compaction originally had no ceiling of its own: its only bound was each
 * provider's 10-minute OkHttp readTimeout, and the split-retry path could issue
 * 1+2+4+8 = 15 sequential leaf calls before depth 3 stopped it, so slow calls
 * accumulated into the ~20-minute hang users reported.
 *
 * The fix for that — a total elapsed-time budget — then caused the opposite
 * failure, because total elapsed time cannot tell a stuck run from a long one.
 * A healthy stream was cancelled at 150s mid-flight after 7,488 events. The
 * budget is now an IDLE timer (time since the last chunk), which measures the
 * thing that actually distinguishes the two, plus a loose total backstop for
 * runaway output. These pin that arithmetic.
