/**
 * [OpenMinis#363] The native handler must READ the abort message, not describe
 * where to find it.
 *
 * Before this change `crash_handler.cpp` wrote a paragraph telling the reader
 * to go look in logcat or the tombstone, and never read the message itself —
 * so the one file a user can actually retrieve carried everything except the
 * reason the process died. That is a failure mode with no build-time signal:
 * the handler still compiles, still writes a report, and the report simply
 * lacks a field. These assertions are the only thing standing between a future
 * tidy-up and a silent return to that state.
 *
 * Source-level by necessity — the unit-test JVM cannot raise SIGABRT in a
 * bionic process, and asserting on C++ through JNI would need an on-device
 * instrumentation run.
