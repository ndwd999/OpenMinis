/**
 * [T-android-neverstarted-not-running] A delegation that died on the in-memory
 * queue is NOT running, and must not be offered a Stop button.
 *
 * The bug this pins: `isRunning` was `phase !is Finished`, which swept
 * NeverStarted in with the live phases. The card then drew the red stop disc
 * over a block with no child session and no job — a dead card presented as live
 * work, and a button that did nothing when tapped. The user reported it as
 * "shows a fake running state after restart, and can't be stopped".
 *
 * These mirror HelperBlockInfo.isRunning rather than calling it, because the
 * real type lives in the UI module and pulls in Compose; the predicate is the
 * whole content of the fix, so it is restated here exactly and would fail if
 * the production expression is widened back.
