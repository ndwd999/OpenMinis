/**
 * [M10][T-anthropic-context-window][T-android-grok-context-underestimate]
 * Context-window defaults for models the catalog has not shipped yet.
 *
 * Two field reports, one mechanism. `LLMModel.contextWindowTokens` answers with
 * a declared `contextWindow` when there is one and otherwise runs an id
 * heuristic, and ContextPolicy turns whatever comes back into
 * `compactThreshold = window - 20_000`. So an UNDER-count does not merely
 * mis-label a number in the Usage sheet — it makes the agent loop compact at a
 * fraction of the real capacity, which reads as "it keeps forgetting" and never
 * points at a context window.
 *
 *   507105f09  every Claude id mapped to 200K, but modern Opus / Sonnet / Fable
 *              are 1M. A fifth of the true window.
 *   33b028477  no xAI branch existed at all, so an uncatalogued Grok id fell
 *              through to the trailing 128K default. iOS measured grok-4.6
 *              compacting 6 times in 47 minutes on that.
 *
 * The heuristic only ever runs for ids models.dev has NOT catalogued — an
 * explicit value always wins — which is why the precedence tests below matter
 * as much as the per-family values. Over-counting is the opposite hazard (a
 * request that 400s for exceeding the real window), so each family pins a
 * specific number rather than "big enough".
 *
 * Two consumers, two functions: `LLMModel.contextWindowTokens` (agent loop,
 * token accounting, compaction) and `inferContextWindowTokens` (the model-group
 * "Limit Context Window" slider ceiling). They are deliberately separate — see
 * ModelContextWindowHeuristic's header — and both are covered here because a
 * divergence between them shows up as a slider that cannot reach the window the
 * loop is actually using.
