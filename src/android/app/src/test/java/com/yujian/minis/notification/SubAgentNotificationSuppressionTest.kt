/**
 * [T-android-subagent-no-system-notification] A sub agent finishing must not
 * post a system notification.
 *
 * Reported: delegating work produced a notification-shade entry titled
 * "代理任务·摘要 …" / "Tap to open the chat and read the response." for a task
 * the user never started — and a parent that delegates several children fires
 * one per child. The result is already delivered into the parent chat as a
 * summary card, so the notification interrupts to announce work the user can
 * already see.
 *
 * iOS never had this. `postBackgroundTaskNotification` has exactly ONE call
 * site there — AIChatViewModel+BackgroundTask, the MAIN chat's
 * background-completion path — and `HelperRunner` (the sub agent runner) posts
 * nothing; it only reads SessionActivityTracker for display. Android diverged
 * because BackgroundTaskNotifier is wired to SessionActivityTracker's
 * completion hook, which fires for EVERY session, children included.
 *
 * The decision lives inside a private coroutine that needs a Context, a
 * ChatRepository and NotificationManagerCompat, so this covers the rule itself
 * plus a source check that the guard is still wired — which is what actually
 * regressed.
