/**
 * [T-android-notification-chronometer] The elapsedRealtime → wall-clock
 * conversion behind `setWhen()`.
 *
 * Why this narrow thing gets a test: it is the only arithmetic in the change,
 * and its failure mode is silent and enormous. `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`
 * counts from boot; `Notification.setWhen()` is read as
 * `System.currentTimeMillis()`. Handing the former straight to the latter puts
 * the timer's origin at the epoch plus the device's uptime — the chip shows
 * days where it should show seconds — and nothing throws or logs.
