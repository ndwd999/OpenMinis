/**
 * [T-android-a11y-screenshot-mount] `ui screenshot` must land somewhere the
 * agent can actually read.
 *
 * Reported by a user driving a11y automation: every capture came back with a
 * path `read_image` answered "File not found" for, so visual analysis stopped
 * dead. The cause was not a permission setting — it was that
 * `getExternalFilesDir("a11y_screenshots")` is bind-mounted **nowhere**.
 * `ExecutionCoordinator.buildSessionBindMounts` exposes only
 * `/var/minis/{attachments,offloads,workspace,browser}` (per session) and
 * `/var/minis/{memory,skills,shared,mcp-servers}` (global), so the host path
 * the CLI returned fell through `PRootKernel.resolveHostPath`'s rootfs
 * fallback to a file that never existed. The misleading "not found" (rather
 * than "cannot resolve") is why this read as a flaky IO error.
 *
 * These are source-text assertions in the style of `ShellExecutionStrategyTest`:
 * the handler needs a live AccessibilityService and a booted PRoot to run, so
 * the contract is pinned where it can be checked without either.
