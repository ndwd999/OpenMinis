/**
 * [T-asr-vendor-family-names] (GH#305) Several widely-used Chinese ASR models
 * never registered as voice models, so the voice-input picker never listed
 * them even though the provider served them.
 *
 * `inferDedicatedVoiceModality` matches an id/name against
 * `asrInferencePatterns` and returns the EXACT ASR shape (audio in → text out).
 * That list only held delimiter-bracketed forms of the literal string "asr"
 * (`-asr`, `asr-`, `_asr`, `asr_`) plus whisper / stt / transcribe. Families
 * named after the model ARCHITECTURE rather than the task matched nothing:
 *
 *   paraformer-realtime-v2   (Alibaba DashScope)  -> no match
 *   SenseVoiceSmall          (FunAudioLLM)        -> no match
 *
 * A non-match is not a loud failure. It falls through to the broad inference,
 * the model gets a general text shape, and the voice pickers — which gate on
 * the EXACT audio-input shape — simply never show it. Silent absence, which is
 * why it went unreported.
 *
 * Both halves of each assertion matter: an ASR model must resolve to audio IN,
 * and it must NOT be mistaken for TTS. A TTS verdict would file it in the wrong
 * picker and make it text-in/audio-out — the exact inverse of what it does.
