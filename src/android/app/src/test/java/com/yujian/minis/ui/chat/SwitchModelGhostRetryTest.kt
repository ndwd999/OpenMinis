/**
 * [T-android-switch-model-ghost-retry] Switching model mid-conversation left
 * the OLD model still retrying.
 *
 * Port of the iOS fix (05d654128), which was reported with a gateway request
 * log: a turn fails 5xx on model A, the user picks model B from the header, B
 * answers every later turn correctly — and the gateway still records further
 * 5xx retries against A, whose error banner sits over the working
 * conversation. The user's own workaround is the diagnostic clue: pressing
 * Stop BEFORE switching prevents it, so cancellation tears this work down and
 * switching model did not.
 *
 * Android had the identical shape: `selectGroup` / `selectGroupEntry` were
 * pure data writes, while the auto-retry ladder sleeps through a 1s/2s/4s
 * countdown holding `currentProvider` — still the abandoned model.
 *
 * The ladder needs a live provider and a real 5xx, so what is verifiable here
 * is the decision logic plus the source facts that encode the wiring.
