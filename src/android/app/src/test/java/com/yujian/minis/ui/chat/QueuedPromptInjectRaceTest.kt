/**
 * [T-android-midtask-msg-vanishes] A message sent while a task is running must
 * not disappear from the chat.
 *
 * Reported by a user on 1.14: while Minis was executing a task, typing a new
 * message got it accepted and answered by the model — but its bubble vanished
 * from the UI until the session was reopened.
 *
 * Root cause, from the user's device log (session 00b40552, 2026-09-17):
 * `injectQueuedPromptsAsNewTurn` snapshotted `_messages.value` into a local
 * (`msgsAfterUnqueue`) and assigned that snapshot back on the Main thread
 * ~100 lines later. In between it suspends four times — ensureSession(),
 * prepareUserAttachments(), buildPastedParts() and appendMessage() (a DB
 * write). Anything appended to `_messages` during that gap was overwritten by
 * the stale snapshot.
 *
 * The gap is not theoretical: in the log the enqueue at 17:22:22.871 was
 * followed by the inject at 17:22:27.706 — **4.8 seconds**. Agent callbacks
 * enqueue PROGRAMMATIC prompts onto the same queue, so a user prompt landing
 * as `queue=2` beside a 9070-char callback happened twice inside four minutes.
 *
 * These tests model the list arithmetic of that emit — the production code is
 * a suspend function on a ViewModel needing a Context, DB and provider, so
 * (as with CompactToolPairingTest and AgentHistoryRebuildIdempotenceTest) the
 * DECISION being pinned is reproduced here rather than the coroutine plumbing.
 * The distinction under test is precisely the one that was wrong: filter a
 * STALE SNAPSHOT vs filter the LIVE list.
