/**
 * [T-android-parallel-toolresult-image-split] The `tool` replies answering one
 * assistant's tool_calls must reach the wire CONTIGUOUSLY, with image carriers
 * appended after the whole run.
 *
 * The reported bug: two parallel `read_image` calls made DeepSeek reject the
 * request with `[400] No tool output found for tool call call_…`. The provider
 * emitted, per result, a `tool` message immediately followed by that result's
 * image-carrier `user` message — so with two calls the carrier landed BETWEEN
 * the two `tool` replies and ended the run, leaving the second call unanswered.
 *
 * With a single image the carrier lands after the only `tool` message and
 * nothing is split, which is exactly why the bug needed TWO parallel calls to
 * appear and why single-image chats always worked.
 *
 * Strictness is the only thing that varied between providers — GLM accepted the
 * same malformed body, DeepSeek did not. The body was wrong in both cases, so
 * this pins the ordering rather than any one provider's tolerance.
 *
 * Mirrors the provider's emission order rather than calling into it: the real
 * loop needs an OkHttp stack and credentials, while the defect is entirely in
 * the sequence the loop produces.
