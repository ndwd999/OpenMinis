/**
 * [T-android-overlay-wide-screen-width] The floating tool capsule must stay a
 * compact pill on wide screens.
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-18: in landscape and on tablets the capsule stretched to
 * "巨长", nearly spanning the display. A cap already existed from the June fix
 * (ec2c759e7, T-android-overlay-landscape-width-rotation-drift) — so this was
 * neither a regression nor a missing tablet branch. The cap was simply set too
 * loose: 400dp is roughly DOUBLE the portrait-phone capsule (196dp on a 393dp
 * Pixel), so the pill still grew noticeably whenever the screen widened.
 *
 * The user's stated reference is the portrait-phone look, so the ceiling is
 * now 240dp. These pin the resulting geometry, because the defect was never
 * "the code has no cap" — it was "the number is wrong", and only arithmetic
 * over real screen widths can catch that.
 *
 * [capsuleWidthDp] mirrors `ToolOverlayController.fixedCapsuleWidthPx()`;
 * that function needs a Context and live displayMetrics, so (as with the other
 * controller-adjacent suites here) the DECISION is reproduced and the source
 * constants are asserted against it.
