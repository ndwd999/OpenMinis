/**
 * [OpenMinis#377] The OFF tier that goes on the wire must be one the MODEL
 * accepts, not just one the VENDOR documents.
 *
 * Reported on Android: Responses API + gpt-6-astra with reasoning effort set to
 * `low`. Compaction hardcodes thinking OFF (it must not spend the output budget
 * on hidden reasoning), the official-OpenAI off tier is `"none"`, and
 * gpt-6-astra mandates reasoning — so every compact died with
 * `[400] reasoning.effort: 'none' is not supported`, including all four halving
 * retries (963 → 481 → 240 → 120 messages). Switching to Chat Completions +
 * gpt-5.6 worked, because that model does accept `none`.
 *
 * These assertions are on the REQUEST BODY rather than on the clamp helper
 * (covered by OffEffortClampTest) because the defect was never in the
 * arithmetic — it was that the OFF branch never consulted the model at all,
 * while the enabled branch beside it always had.

     * The OpenAI-native Chat arm keeps sending its off tier unconditionally,

     * models.dev lists `none` for only ~37% of the entries that declare effort
     * tiers (1209/3243 in the bundled catalog), and o1/o3/o4-mini declare
     * exactly `[low, medium, high]` — indistinguishable from gpt-6-astra's
     * `[low…max]` — yet have always accepted `none`. No rule over catalog data
     * alone separates "forgot to list none" from "rejects none", so clamping
     * here would change the wire format for the whole o-series on a guess.
     *
     * The reported 400 is on the Responses path, which is where the fix lives.
     * Pinned here so the asymmetry is a decision on record, not a gap.
