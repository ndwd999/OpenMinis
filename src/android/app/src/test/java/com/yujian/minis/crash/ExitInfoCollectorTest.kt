/**
 * [OpenMinis#363] The recovery path for a process death nothing in-process
 * survived to describe.
 *
 * Two seams, because they need different tools:
 *
 *  • The pure decisions — which exit reasons are worth a file, how they are
 *    named — are real unit tests.
 *  • Everything else is a call into ActivityManager / ApplicationExitInfo /
 *    SharedPreferences. This module has no Robolectric and runs with
 *    `unitTests.isReturnDefaultValues = true`, so those classes are
 *    zero-returning stubs here: a "test" driving them would assert that a stub
 *    did nothing. Those parts are pinned as SOURCE assertions instead, which is
 *    honest about what is being checked — that a future refactor cannot
 *    silently drop the high-water mark, the native-crash filter, or the
 *    tombstone read, each of which fails invisibly (the log file simply stops
 *    carrying the field) rather than breaking a build.
