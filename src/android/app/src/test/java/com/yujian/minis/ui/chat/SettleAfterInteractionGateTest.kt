/**
 * [T-android-settle-programmatic-scroll] The post-drag settle re-pin must fire
 * only when the scroll that just ended was the USER'S drag, never when it was
 * the streaming auto-follow's own `scroll { }` glide.
 *
 * Measured on a Pixel 4a streaming 300 short paragraphs: the settle fired 103
 * times in one turn, once after each follow glide, because it keyed on the
 * `isScrollInProgress -> false` edge that programmatic scrolls also produce.
 * On screen that read as an eased glide followed by an instant snap, over and
 * over. The gate replaces that edge with "a finger lifted recently".
