/**
 * [T-android-fab-up-target] The scroll-to-previous-turn button walks "the
 * user's turns". This pins what that means.
 *
 * The bug: `role == "user"` was used as the test, but two kinds of
 * system-written message carry the user role and render as their own card
 * instead of a `user:` bubble — a scheduled task's prompt and a sub agent
 * callback. Counting them made the button aim at turns with no row to land on,
 * so it either stopped on the wrong content or fell through to RESTORE and
 * looked dead. It surfaced once sub agent cards shipped, because that is when
 * callbacks started appearing in quantity.
 *
 * These assertions are the contract between the walk and
 * `buildFlatChatItems`: anything that returns true here must be emitted as a
 * `UserBubble` there, and anything false must not be.
