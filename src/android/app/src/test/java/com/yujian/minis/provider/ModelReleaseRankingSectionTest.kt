/**
 * [M22] Release-date ranking INSIDE a picker section, and the two properties the
 * existing files each cover only half of.
 *
 * Pins 710b43a64 (the ANR: ranking was evaluated once per COMPARISON rather than
 * once per element) and the comparator's full key order.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE:
 *  • ModelEntryRankingTest works on real `ModelEntry`s but, as its own header
 *    says, cannot see release dates at all — `ModelReleaseIndex` reads a 4.5 MB
 *    catalog out of app assets, unreachable without a Context, so every entry
 *    ranks as undated there. So it verifies survival and stability, not order.
 *  • ModelReleaseIndexTest asserts real ordering, but on synthetic `Rank`s
 *    in isolation, and only on the releaseDay key.
 *  • ModelReleaseSortShapeTest asserts the rank-once shape against a
 *    hand-rolled stand-in, by its own admission "the algorithmic shape, not the
 *    repository's own wiring".
 *
 * The gap between the three is the part a user actually sees: a SECTION of
 * mixed-vintage models ordered by the full comparator, with the ranking
 * evaluated once. This file closes it by driving the real comparator over
 * synthetic Ranks that carry every key — which is the only honest way to assert
 * date order in a JVM test — and by pinning the production shape by source
 * rather than by stand-in.
