/**
 * [T-android-group-resolve-skip-uncredentialed] Pins the selection rule used by
 * `ChatViewModel.resolveProviderFromGroup` + `ProviderRepository.availableMemberEntries`
 * (mirrors iOS `ModelGroupRouter.resolve` / `availableEntryIds`).
 *
 * Same shape as ModelGroupReorderTest: the repository needs Context + Room +
 * EncryptedSharedPreferences, so this exercises the pure decision rule those
 * methods implement — filter the members down to the usable ones FIRST, then
 * apply the routing strategy. That ordering is the whole contract.
 *
 * The regression being pinned: selection used to take the first *enabled*
 * member and only then check its credential, abandoning the entire group when
 * that one member had none. A group of otherwise-usable models therefore
 * resolved to nothing, and the caller fell through to the new-chat default
 * chain — which picks by "most recently added provider" and so ran the session
 * on a model that was not in the group the user had selected.
