/**
 * [T-android-vad-manual-stop] The reported bug: tapping stop on a provider-ASR
 * (VAD) take left the panel on "Recognizing…" forever — the detector was torn
 * down before it could emit the segment, so no onFinal AND no onError ever
 * reached SpeechRecognitionManager, which stayed in FINISHING.
 *
 * The invariant these cases pin: a manual stop with an active session always
 * resolves to something that ends in a terminal callback.
