/**
 * [T-gpt6-astra-effort] Android counterpart to iOS `GPT6AstraReasoningTests`.
 *
 * A user picked "xhigh" on gpt-6-astra and iOS put `reasoning: {effort: "low"}`
 * on the wire. The cause was a data gap, not a logic bug: `LLMModel.gpt6Astra`
 * never declared `supportsReasoning`, the model was too new to be matched by
 * the bundled models.dev catalog that normally fills that flag in, and the
 * Responses builder's "Codex OAuth requires a reasoning object" fallback
 * hard-codes effort "low". The user's level was never consulted.
 *
 * Android's static entry already declares the flag, so the reported bug does
 * not reproduce here. That is worth pinning rather than asserting in prose:
 * the protection is one boolean in a list of model literals, and nothing about
 * deleting it would look wrong in review. These tests fail if it goes.
 *
 * Where the two platforms actually differ: both ceilings bail only on
 * `supportsReasoning == false` (iOS LLMTypes.catalogMaxThinkingLevel is the
 * same), so an undeclared (null) flag reaches MAX on both. iOS's `?? false`
 * lives one layer down, in the WIRE guard `reasoningEffort(for:)`, which
 * returned nil for a nil flag and dropped into the Codex "low" fallback.
 * Android's Responses builder has no supportsReasoning guard on its enabled
 * path, so the same nil flag never reached that fallback here. The third
 * test pins the ceiling half; the wire tests pin the builder half.
