/**
 * [T-android-revert-history-duplication] Rebuilding `agentHistory` from the DB
 * must be IDEMPOTENT — running it twice has to leave the same list as running
 * it once.
 *
 * The bug this pins: `loadSession()` rebuilt the list with a bare
 * `agentHistory.addAll(loaded.llmHistory)`, justified by a comment saying
 * "loadSession runs once at init before any sender writes into agentHistory".
 * That stopped being true the moment `revertCompact()` began calling
 * `reloadSessionFromDb()` -> `loadSession()` on an already-open session whose
 * history was fully populated: the addAll stacked a SECOND copy of every
 * persisted message onto the first.
 *
 * Measured on device before the fix — same session, same 20 DB rows: the next
 * request after a revert carried 31 rows with the first 12 duplicated, while a
 * cold restart of that same session sent 21. The database was never wrong; only
 * the in-memory list was. The model saw the user say everything twice, and the
 * duplicated prefix also guarantees a prompt-cache miss for the whole request.
 *
 * Why this test is shaped this way:
 *
 *  - The assertion is the device check turned into something automatable:
 *    **rebuilt history size == DB row count, exactly 1:1**, which is what was
 *    verified by hand after the fix (33 request rows == 34 DB rows - 1 in
 *    flight). No emulator, no Context, no DAO needed.
 *
 *  - `rebuild` mirrors the production shape (clear-then-fill) rather than
 *    driving a real ChatViewModel, which needs a Context, a database and a
 *    provider to construct. Same approach as CompactToolPairingTest and
 *    InLoopContextPolicyTest.
 *
 *  - The cold-start path and the revert path are asserted to produce
 *    IDENTICAL lists, because that equivalence is the actual product
 *    requirement: reverting a compaction must leave you exactly where a fresh
 *    launch would.
