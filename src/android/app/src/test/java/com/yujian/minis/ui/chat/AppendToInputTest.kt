/**
 * [T-android-append-to-input-eats-draft] "Add to input" must not rewrite the
 * draft the user has already typed.
 *
 * The bug this pins: the old implementation computed `current.trimEnd()` and
 * assigned that trimmed copy back into the composer. Trimming leaked from the
 * emptiness *predicate* into the *assignment*, so appending a snippet silently
 * ate a trailing newline the user had deliberately typed — their paragraph
 * break collapsed into a single separator space, with no undo.
 *
 * Ported from iOS `e6c0ace6a`, which fixed the byte-for-byte same defect.
