/**
 * [T-android-mount-fileprovider-root] A file inside a mounted folder can be
 * shared and opened with another app.
 *
 * Reported (2026-09-24, with log + screen recording): an .xlsx the agent wrote
 * into a mounted folder showed in the file preview, but Share failed with
 * "Failed to find configured root that contains
 * /storage/emulated/0/agents/meituan/…xlsx", and "Open externally" said
 * "No app available to open this file." Both went through
 * FileProvider.getUriForFile, and no declared root covered shared storage —
 * mounts are picked with OpenDocumentTree (on-device only) and used by their
 * real /storage path.
 *
 * FileProvider needs a Context, so this reads the declared roots from the
 * resource and applies its matching rule (a file is covered when its path
 * lies under a root's directory). Only the storage roots are resolved;
 * files-/cache- paths live under the app's private dir and cannot match.
