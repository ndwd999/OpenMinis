/**
 * [OpenMinis#377] Clamping the OFF tier onto what a model actually accepts.
 *
 * Reported on Android: Responses API + gpt-6-astra, reasoning effort set to
 * `low`, and every compaction died with
 * `[400] reasoning.effort: 'none' is not supported` (server listing
 * low/medium/high/xhigh/max as the supported set). The off tier is chosen by
 * ENDPOINT — official OpenAI → "none" — and was never checked against the
 * MODEL, so a model that mandates reasoning received an illegal value.
