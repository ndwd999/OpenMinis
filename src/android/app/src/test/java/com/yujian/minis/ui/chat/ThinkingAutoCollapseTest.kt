/**
 * [T-android-thinking-collapse-latch] When a thinking block folds itself away.
 *
 * The composable needs a live composition, so this pins the decision it makes,
 * which is the whole user-visible behaviour: "Deep Thinking opens itself while
 * the model thinks and folds away when it stops — unless you deliberately held
 * it shut."
 *
 * The reported bug: a thinking block that had been expanded never collapsed
 * again. `ThinkingBlock` guarded the stream-end auto-collapse with a single
 * `userTouched: Boolean`, so a user who tapped to collapse and tapped again to
 * re-open latched it true permanently and the auto-collapse stopped firing for
 * the rest of the conversation. A one-bit flag cannot tell WHICH way the user
 * pushed; the guard is now the direction itself.
