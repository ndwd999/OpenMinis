/**
 * [T-android-image-path-metadata] The placeholder that stands in for image
 * pixels when the target model has no native vision.
 *
 * The rule under test: the image's sandbox path is surfaced whenever we have
 * one, INDEPENDENT of whether a Vision Group is configured. The Vision Group
 * decides which recourse to name, not whether the model learns where the file
 * is — `shell_execute` is exposed unconditionally and runs in the same PRoot
 * sandbox, so a path is actionable (file / identify / OCR / Pillow) with no
 * Vision Group at all. Withholding it produced a dead end; iOS observed a
 * model trying to route around that dead end by inventing a CLI.
