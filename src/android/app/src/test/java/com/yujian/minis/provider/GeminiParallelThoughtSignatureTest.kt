/**
 * [T-android-gemini3-parallel-thoughtsig] Which historical tool calls may be
 * replayed to Gemini 3.x as real `functionCall` parts.
 *
 * Gemini emits ONE thoughtSignature for a whole parallel batch, attached to the
 * FIRST functionCall; the rest legitimately carry none. The original per-call
 * rule ([T-android-gemini3-thoughtsig] #179) therefore replayed the signed call
 * as a functionCall and downgraded its siblings to text, splitting a batch the
 * signature describes as a whole — and Gemini answered
 * `400 "Corrupted thought signature."`.
 *
 * Reproduced on a Pixel 6 (gemini-3.8-flash): one assistant message holding five
 * parallel `subagent_task` calls, exactly one with a signature of length 4096
 * and four null. Every `retryLast` after an app restart hit the 400, because a
 * restart is what forces the history to be rebuilt from the persisted parts.
 *
 * The rule is now all-or-nothing per MESSAGE, since a signature belongs to the
 * model turn rather than to an individual call. This pins the decision itself;
 * the request-body assembly around it is unchanged.
