/**
 * [T-model-release-ranking] Covers the ordering the model picker sheets now
 * share with `ProviderRepository`.
 *
 * NOTE what a JVM test can and cannot see here. `ModelReleaseIndex` builds
 * itself from `ModelsDevApi.registrySnapshot()`, which reads the 4.5 MB
 * catalog out of app assets — unavailable without a Context, so every entry
 * ranks as undated in this environment. Asserting "newer model first" with
 * real model ids would therefore assert nothing (the first draft of this file
 * did exactly that: it passed, and still passed when the comparator was
 * replaced with a plain id sort). Release-date ordering is covered where it
 * can be honest, on synthetic Ranks, in `ModelReleaseIndexTest`.
 *
 * What IS verifiable here is the part that made extracting this object worth
 * doing: undated entries survive, the tie-break is total and stable, and short
 * lists never touch the index at all.
