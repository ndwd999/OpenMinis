/**
 * [M16] The Claude id → (major, minor) PARSER, and the three unrelated
 * behaviours it silently drives.
 *
 * Pins 69be65763 / 500abe41b / 243dadf30. Root cause of all three symptoms was
 * one regex: the minor segment was REQUIRED, so a single-segment id
 * (`claude-fable-5`, `claude-opus-5`) parsed as null instead of (5, 0). Every
 * consumer reads that null as "not a versioned Claude", so one parse failure
 * produced three different user-visible faults at once:
 *
 *   1. `modelRejectsTemperature` → false → the API answered
 *      400 "temperature is deprecated for this model".
 *   2. `modelUsesAdaptiveThinking` → false → the request carried the legacy
 *      `budget_tokens` form, which 4.6+ silently IGNORES. Thinking appeared to
 *      be on and did nothing.
 *   3. `supportsThinking` → false → the Deep Thinking toggle never appeared for
 *      the whole 5-series.
 *
 * WHY A DEDICATED FILE. AnthropicProviderTest already asserts the three
 * CONSUMERS for the 5-series. This pins the parser's own contract instead,
 * because the consumers are all monotone threshold tests (`>= 4.6`) and
 * therefore cannot distinguish the answers that matter most here: a
 * `claude-3-5-sonnet` misparsed as (3, 0) and a `claude-sonnet-4-6` misparsed as
 * (4, 0) both answer "no" to all three questions, exactly as the correct parse
 * of (3, 5) does for the first. So a regression that re-broke the greedy pair
 * match would leave every consumer assertion green. Parsing the version out of
 * the id is its own claim and is asserted as one.
 *
 * `parseClaudeVersion` is private, so the algorithm is PORTED VERBATIM below
 * from AnthropicProvider.kt:840-848 (companion object) and paired with a
 * source-grep drift guard plus consumer cross-checks that tie the port back to
 * the shipping code.
