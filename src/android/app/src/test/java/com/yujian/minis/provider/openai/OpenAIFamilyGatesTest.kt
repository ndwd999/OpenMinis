/**
 * [M19 / M20] The per-family GATES on the OpenAI-compatible request body: which
 * ids and which endpoints a given field is allowed to reach.
 *
 * Every row here is a field that one vendor requires and another rejects, so
 * each is asserted BOTH present where it belongs and absent where it does not —
 * an over-broad gate is a 400 for someone else, which is how each of these was
 * reported in the first place.
 *
 * Pins:
 *  • #35 / a5a0de20d / 8db455fff / 20bd0367b / bd68bf809 — `thinking_budget`
 *    must be STRICTLY below `max_completion_tokens`.
 *  • 672fc4de9 / 251657006 / 8b72080da — the DashScope dual-send is scoped to
 *    DashScope; a third-party gateway serving the same qwen id must not get it.
 *  • fb671083 / 838ba929 — Fast Mode's `service_tier: "priority"` is gated to
 *    gpt-family ids on the Responses path.
 *  • GH#191 — the OpenRouter `anthropic/` prefix routes Anthropic-shaped quirks.
 *  • The `startsWith("o")` reasoning predicate, which is deliberately BROADER on
 *    Android than on iOS (see the cross-check at the bottom).
 *
 * Seam: the production body builders (`buildRequestBody` /
 * `buildResponsesAPIBody`) are `internal` and documented as directly callable
 * from unit tests, which is the honest place to read a field-placement decision
 * — going through MockWebServer would add a network dependency to a question
 * that is pure JSON construction.
