/**
 * [T-android-subagent-control-capsule] / [T-android-subagent-control-not-lost]
 *
 * A `subagent_task` call carrying an action other than `delegate` is the model
 * operating on sub agents it already started. It gets the ordinary tool capsule
 * rather than a delegation card — and, critically, must not be judged by the
 * delegation queue's rules.
 *
 * The bug this pins: a steer's result is `{"status":"queued", ...}`, and the
 * card asked "is this tool_use id still in the delegation queue?" to decide
 * between "Queued" and "Never started". A steer is never in that queue — it
 * waits in the CHILD's pending list — so the answer was false from the very
 * first read, and every steer was badged yellow "Never started" while its own
 * result text said "Queued. The sub agent reads it at its next turn." The badge
 * and the body asserted opposite things about the same call.
