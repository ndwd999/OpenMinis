/**
 * [T-android-overlay-completion-survives-stop] Source guards for the two ways
 * the new keep-alive could regress into a pinned foreground service.
 *
 * Making a pending capsule keep the service alive means an un-tapped capsule
 * now costs a foreground service and its wake lock. Two things prevent that
 * from being unbounded, and both are easy to undo by accident:
 *
 *  1. the completion branch arms a timeout that clears the latch, and
 *  2. the `shouldShow` block cancels that timer ONLY when busy — the cancel
 *     used to be unconditional at the top of the block, which was harmless
 *     while the linger was unbounded but would now kill the timer on the very
 *     next emission and restore the pinning behaviour.
