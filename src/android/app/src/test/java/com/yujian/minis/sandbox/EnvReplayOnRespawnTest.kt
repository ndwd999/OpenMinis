/**
 * [T-android-env-first-turn] Guards the two source-level invariants behind the
 * "first tool call has no environment variables" report.
 *
 * The real failure needs a cold-start shell death under proot + SELinux, which
 * a JVM unit test cannot stage. What it CAN do is pin the two properties whose
 * absence caused it, both of which were silent regressions waiting to happen:
 *
 *  1. PRootKernel.boot() must serialize. It sets `isBooted` only at the end,
 *     so a bare check-then-act let a second caller spawn a shell while
 *     PROOT_LOADER was still unset — proot then bare-execve'd busybox and
 *     SELinux killed it.
 *  2. applyEnvironment() must record its snapshot BEFORE the liveness check,
 *     and ensureStarted() must replay it. Otherwise exports written to a shell
 *     that is already dead are lost, and the respawn that actually runs the
 *     command starts bare.
 *
 * Asserting on source text is deliberate: these are ordering properties of code
 * that needs a device to execute, and a comment alone would not fail the build
 * when someone reinstates `if (!isAlive) return` at the top.
