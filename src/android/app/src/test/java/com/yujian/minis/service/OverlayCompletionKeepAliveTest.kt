/**
 * [T-android-overlay-completion-survives-stop] The completion capsule must
 * outlive the stream that produced it.
 *
 * Reported: "任务结束后悬浮窗就退出了，没有展示完成状态和 last message". The
 * linger itself was implemented (AgentForegroundService renders an outcome
 * glyph, a localized completion word and the reply excerpt when `!isRunning`),
 * and the reply is published BEFORE `setInactive` at all five agent-loop exit
 * sites — so the state was right. What killed it was ownership: the capsule is
 * a WindowManager view owned by AgentForegroundService, and the end-of-turn
 * `setInactive` could stop that service in the same call, whose `onDestroy`
 * unconditionally hides the capsule and cancels the observer scope.
 *
 * These are pure-JVM assertions about the keep-alive predicate. The real
 * `shouldRunService()` is private to the tracker and touches a Context, so the
 * predicate is restated here; `the restated predicate matches the source`
 * guards the copy against drift.
