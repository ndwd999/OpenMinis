/**
 * [GH#325] `clearChat()` must refresh the session row it just emptied.
 *
 * A source guard rather than a behavioural test, deliberately and with the
 * limitation stated: `clearChat` lives on a ViewModel that needs an Android
 * Context, a Room database and a repository graph, and this module has no
 * Robolectric — so there is no way to invoke it in a JVM unit test. The choice
 * is between pinning the call at the source level and pinning nothing at all.
 * `OverlayLingerTimeoutGuardTest` and `InAppThemeSourceGuardTest` take the same
 * approach for the same reason.
 *
 * What went wrong: clearing a chat deleted every message but left `updated_at`
 * pinned to the last of them. The session list sorts and date-buckets on that
 * column, so a chat cleared seconds ago stayed filed under an old date — and
 * inside a group the accordion had collapsed, it rendered nowhere at all. Users
 * reported the session as deleted when every row and file was still present.
