/**
 * [T-android-queued-visual] A queued sub agent must be distinguishable from one
 * that is about to run.
 *
 * Reported from a side-by-side screenshot of a five-way fan-out: three agents
 * were running and two were waiting for a slot, and the two waiting ones wore
 * the SAME generic Groups avatar and the same muted grey second line as the
 * others. The only thing separating "held" from "starting" was the word itself.
 * iOS draws `pause.fill` in the avatar (HelperBlockView.swift:589) and paints
 * the status in the agent accent (:313).
 *
 * The composables need a live composition, so what is pinned here is the phase
 * classification the avatar and the status line switch on — a queued payload
 * must parse to [HelperPhase.Queued] and nothing else, since every visual
 * decision hangs off that.

     * apart). The first run of this test asserted the wrong thing and caught
     * that: enqueue the block so the phase under test is reachable at all.
