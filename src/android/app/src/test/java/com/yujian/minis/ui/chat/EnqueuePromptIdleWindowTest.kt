/**
 * [T-android-enqueue-idle-window] Does Android have the "enqueue evaporates in
 * the idle window" race that the SubAgent design doc (§2.4.1) attributes to iOS?
 *
 * iOS shape (per the doc): `enqueuePrompt` ACCEPTS the prompt whenever the guard
 * passes, and the only consumer is `drainQueuedPrompts` at the agent loop's
 * epilogue. A prompt enqueued after the loop's last drain but before the next
 * `send()` therefore has no consumer — it sits in the queue forever.
 *
 * This test models Android's ACTUAL control flow, transcribed from
 * ChatViewModel.kt:
 *
 *   sendMessage(text)                          :6292
 *     if (_isStreaming.value) { enqueuePrompt(text); return }   :6311-6314
 *     _isStreaming.value = true                                 :6377  (synchronous)
 *     launch {  runAgentLoop(); drainQueuedPrompts()            :6561-6571
 *               ... ; if (owner) _isStreaming.value = false }   :6602-6604
 *
 *   enqueuePrompt(text)                        :5944
 *     if (blank || !_isStreaming.value) return                  :5947  (REJECTS when idle)
 *
 * Two structural differences from iOS decide the outcome, and this test pins
 * both:
 *
 *   1. The drain at :6571 runs INSIDE the try, BEFORE `_isStreaming` is cleared
 *      at :6604. So the "queue accepted, loop already past its drain" window
 *      cannot open — while the flag is still true, a drain is still ahead.
 *   2. `enqueuePrompt` REJECTS on `!_isStreaming` rather than accepting. Anything
 *      arriving after the flag clears is not queued at all; it is routed by
 *      `sendMessage`'s own guard into a fresh send. Nothing is stranded.
 *
 * Both reads and the flag write happen on Dispatchers.Main with no suspension
 * between check and act, so there is no check-then-act gap to exploit.
