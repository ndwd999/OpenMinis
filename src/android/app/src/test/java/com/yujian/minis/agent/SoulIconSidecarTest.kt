/**
 * [T-android-soul-icon-sidecar] The `icon:` frontmatter value, at the disk
 * boundary.
 *
 * A picked avatar is ~20 KB of base64. Held inline it turned a small,
 * human-readable persona file into one whose bulk is a single unreadable line.
 * The bytes now live in a `SOUL.icon.png` sidecar and the frontmatter holds
 * only its name.
 *
 * SOUL.md is a file users carry between builds and platforms, so the value that
 * key can hold is a cross-device contract: this pins the name iOS also writes,
 * and pins that the older inline form is still recognised rather than being
 * mistaken for a filename.
 *
 * Real PNG encode/decode is exercised on device (android.util.Base64 is a stub
 * in JVM unit tests); what is pinned here is the classification that decides
 * WHICH path a stored value takes, which is where a cross-platform mismatch
 * would actually bite.
