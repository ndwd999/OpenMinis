/**
 * [T-android-hwkeyboard-virtual-false-positive] The hardware-keyboard rule
 * must not be satisfied by a VIRTUAL alphabetic device.
 *
 * Reported on a Pixel 4a: after sending a message the on-screen keyboard
 * stayed up. The composer's "keep focus with a hardware keyboard" gate
 * (cdf61e8ff) read `Configuration.keyboard == KEYBOARD_QWERTY`, and a
 * `scrcpy --keyboard=uhid` session had registered a virtual HID keyboard
 * (`bus=0x0006`, `Classes: KEYBOARD | ALPHAKEY`, `Generic.kcm`), which is
 * enough for Android to report `qwerty/v/v`. So a touch-only phone was
 * treated as having physical keys, and `releaseComposerAfterSend()` skipped
 * the IME dismiss.
 *
 * These pin the per-device predicate against the device inventory captured
 * from that phone's `dumpsys input`, so each real device on it lands on the
 * intended side.
