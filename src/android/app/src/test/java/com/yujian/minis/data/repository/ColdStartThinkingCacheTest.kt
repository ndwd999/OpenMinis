/**
 * [GH#306] Cold start must warm the custom-thinking-rule cache.
 *
 * The reported symptom: a custom thinking rule works right after you save it, then
 * silently stops applying after the app is killed and restarted — the rule is still
 * on disk and still shown in Settings, but requests carry the built-in wire format.
 *
 * The mechanism is a RACE, which is why it was hard to pin down (on a Pixel 6 the
 * synchronous callers won 3/3 cold starts, so the bug did not surface there):
 *
 *   ensureConfigLoaded()  early-returns at the top when `_configLoaded` is true, and
 *                         only calls loadAllThinkingRulesIntoCache() AFTER its
 *                         synchronized block.
 *   the init coroutine    sets `_configLoaded = true` asynchronously.
 *
 *   loader wins the race -> every later ensureConfigLoaded() early-returns -> the warm
 *                           is never reached -> custom rules silently fall back.
 *   a caller wins        -> takes the synchronized path -> falls through to the warm.
 *
 * A JVM unit test cannot drive Android's async init, so this is a source-fact check on
 * the invariant that closes the window: the branch that SETS the flag must also warm
 * the cache. If someone later removes that call, this fails instead of the bug
 * reappearing as an intermittent field report.
