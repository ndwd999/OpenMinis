/**
 * [T-android-refresh-models-empty-key] "Refresh model list" failed for a
 * self-hosted provider configured with no API key.
 *
 * `ProviderRepository.refreshModels` read the credential with `loadApiKey`,
 * which returns null when nothing is stored, and its provider-API step is
 * gated on `apiKey != null`. So for a keyless local server the fetch was never
 * attempted: the flow fell through to the models.dev lookup, which knows
 * nothing about a private host, and the user saw a failure describing the
 * fallback rather than the server they had pointed at.
 *
 * The fix routes it through `usableApiKey`, which substitutes "" exactly where
 * an empty key is a valid configuration. That decision is
 * `ProviderInstance.allowsEmptyAPIKey`, pinned here — `refreshModels` itself
 * needs a Context and encrypted prefs, so this covers the predicate the fix
 * turns on rather than the coroutine around it.
 *
 * Both directions matter. Widening this predicate would send unauthenticated
 * requests to official endpoints; narrowing it re-breaks the reported case.
